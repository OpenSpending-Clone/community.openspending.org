Glad to see you here! 

This site is for enthusiastic doers, citizens and budget nerds from
across the world. We care deeply about welcoming everyone regardless
of skills and will do what we can to help you getting started!

## Connect with the Community

There's lots of discussion happening on our
[OpenSpending Forums](https://discuss.okfn.org/c/openspending).  We
also have an IRC channel on Freenode: 
[#openspending](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=openspending). You're

## Contribute to the Fiscal Data Package Spec

We're hard at work on defining
[Fiscal Data Package](http://fiscal.dataprotocols.org/).  Fiscal Data
Package is a simple, open technical specification for government
budget and spending data.

We welcome input from the community regarding the specification. You
can already contribute to the development process by leaving
suggestions and queries in the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/openspending/fiscal-data-package/issues).

## Follow the Development of OpenSpending Next

[OpenSpending Next](/next/) is the next generation of the OpenSpending
platform.  We are now creating a "minimum viable product" version.
This includes a
[Fiscal Data Packager](https://github.com/openspending/fiscal-data-packager)
and an [import tool](https://github.com/openspending/os-import).

## Upload and Package Your Data

One way to contribute right now is by adding data sources to our
[registry tracker](https://github.com/os-data/registry/issues).

* Open a new issue
* Write a brief description of the data
* Provide a link to the data (hosted as flat files on GitHub would be best, if possible)

This allows us to look at the data and see how well it fits with our
current assumptions. We can then work together on steps to get the
data imported into the flat file DataStore.

## Code

* [OpenSpending on GitHub](https://github.com/openspending)
* [Fiscal Data Packager](https://github.com/openspending/fiscal-data-packager)
* [OpenSpending Import](https://github.com/openspending/os-import)
