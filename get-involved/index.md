## Contribute to the Open Fiscal Data Package

If you're interested in publishing your fiscal data as open data, we'd recommend you take a look
at the Fiscal Data Package.

If you'd like to learn more about it, you can read our brief introduction [here]({% link about/fiscaldatapackage.md %}).
If you are and advanced user, you can read the [Specification](https://frictionlessdata.io/specs/fiscal-data-package/)

If you have comments about it, we welcome input from the community regarding the specification. You
can contribute to the development process by leaving suggestions and
queries in the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/openspending/fiscal-data-package/issues).
