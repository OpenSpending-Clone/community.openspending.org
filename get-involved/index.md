## Contribute to the Fiscal Data Package Standard

We're hard at work on defining
[Fiscal Data Package](http://fiscal.dataprotocols.org/), a simple,
open technical specification for describing government budget and
spending data.

We welcome input from the community regarding the specification. You
can contribute to the development process by leaving suggestions and
queries in the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/openspending/fiscal-data-package/issues).

## Contribute to the Development of OpenSpending Next

[OpenSpending Next](/next/) is the next generation of the OpenSpending
platform. Based on the Fiscal Data Package Specification, it comes with a range of tools enabling the data upload, search, analysis and visualisation.

## Upload and Package Your Data

Contribute fiscal data sources to our
[registry tracker](https://github.com/os-data/registry/issues).  The process is simple:

* [Open a new issue](https://github.com/os-data/registry/issues/new?title=Dataset&body=Link:%0ADescription:)
* Write a brief description of the data and how to interpret it
* Provide a link to the data (hosted as flat files (e.g. CSV or XLSX) on GitHub would be best, if possible)

This will allow us to look at the data and see how well it fits with our
current assumptions. We can then work together on steps to get the
data imported into the flat file DataStore.
