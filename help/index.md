            OpenSpending offers an easy-to-use system to upload, explore and 
            share public finance data - such as budgets or expenditure 
            databases.
        </p>
        <p>
            While we offer search and visualization features to easily slice 
            and dice financial data, our API is even more powerful: it 
            enables anyone to create their own visualizations and budget apps,
            without the hassle of managing data access.

            The site is offered as a free service. All code, content and 
            data are shared and openly licensed. No user of the platform will
            have to become dependent on the site. Our sustainability model
            includes both grant funding, and commercial services provided to 
            CSOs, governments, media and international organizations. If 
            you are interested in working with us,
