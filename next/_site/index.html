    <strong>OpenSpending Next</strong> is the next generation of the OpenSpending platform. All the documentation and specifications for work on Open Spending Next can be found here.

  <h2>Roadmap</h2>
  <p>
    We are currently working towards a minimal viable product (MVP) of the new architecture discussed in <a href="http://labs.openspending.org/osep/osep-01.html">OSEP-01</a> and subsequent OSEPs. A roadmap is in place for 2015, and we are inviting interested developers to help by forming work teams.

  <h2>Tech Lead Group</h2>
  <p>
    The OpenSpending Tech Lead Group is a group of developers and domain experts who are helping Open Knowledge push forward with the new Open Spending roadmap.
  </p>
  <p>
    Tasks the group is involved with:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Working through the existing OpenSpending Enhancement Proposals, and making new ones (of course, **anyone** can submit an OSEP, just <a href=" http://labs.openspending.org/osep/">follow the guidelines here</a>)</li>
    <li>Breaking up the general architecture into sets of specific components that individuals or teams may want to 'take ownership' over</li>
    <li>Synchronising our plans with other spend data projects - it is a complex area, and one we all want to solve well, so we want to do it together</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This is **not** a formal committee that has to sign off on every step along the path. Rather, it will be a group that helps bring the existing ideas into fruition, as well as discuss, debate and enhance them. The group will be limited to 5-10 participants.
  </p>

  <h2>Enhancement Proposals</h2>
  <p>
    Open Spending Enhancement Proposals (OSEPs) are how we introduce large changes to OpenSpending. Anyone can put forward an enhancement proposal.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://labs.openspending.org/osep/">All OSEPs</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://labs.openspending.org/osep/osep-00.html">OSEP Guidelines</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Specifications</h2>
  <p>We are taking a just in time approach to specs. User stories and use cases should exist first, and from there, implementation details should be devised by working teams.</p>
