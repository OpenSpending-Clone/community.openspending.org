<div class="well">Project: <a href="http://www.budgetstories.md/">Budgetstories, Moldova.</a></div>
<p>In mid 2012, Expert Grup began to work to make sense of huge budget<br />
datasets. In November 2012, while finalizing the project concept,<br />
members of the organising team took part in the [Balkan Budget<br />
Workshop](http://openspending.org/blog/2012/11/26/Sarajevo-Workshop-Writeup.html) organised by the OpenSpending team.</p>
<p>> “It was really helpful to learn about data formats. It is the equivalent<br />
> of a data literacy 101 class.” - <strong> Victoria Vlad </strong></p>

<p>## About the team </p>
<p>The core BudgetStories.md team at Expert Grup<br />
consists of three core staff members: the project director, one project<br />
communication and analytical expert, and one additional analytic expert<br />
as support. The implementation was made with an external web design<br />
company who executed the website based on input from the team. The web<br />
company had a total of five people working on BudgetStories.md: two<br />
designers, two developers, and one project manager.</p>
<p>Expert Grup has introduced several projects using open budget and<br />
spending data. The main challenges they've encountered have related to<br />
accessing data, cleaning the data (using Excel), and managing the data<br />
visualisation work, which was done by an an external web agency.</p>
<p>Most of the needed data was available to the public on<br />
[data.gov.md](http://data.gov.md/) and in the World Bank's [BOOST data<br />
tool](http://www.mf.gov.md/ro/BOOST/), and government agencies were open<br />
to providing direct requests for data requested in a timely manner. The<br />
data was analysed with Excel. During the research, Expert Grup used the<br />
<a href="http://community.openspending.org/resources/handbook/">Spending Data Handbook</a>, the <a href="http://opendatahandbook.org/">Open Data Handbook</a> and the <a href="http://datajournalismhandbook.org/">Data Journalism<br />
Handbook</a> as resources.</p>
<p>## Technical challenges</p>
<p>### Presenting the data<br />
> “It is still a challenge for us to make visualizations meaningful. We plan to improve with every infographic we<br />
> publish.” </p>
<p>Expert Grup is planning to work more on developing their<br />
presentations of their data. Most of their visualisations have been<br />
developed by a web agency based on the directions from Expert Grup. One<br />
exception is the visualisation of the [Moldova<br />
budget](http://www.budgetstories.md/bugetul-2013/), which was created with<br />
OpenSpending treemaps by Expert Grup.</p>
<p>In the future Expert Grup wil be looking to expand their work.</p>
<p>> “There is still a lot of work to be done. We have until now published three data<br />
> visualizations.”</p>
<p>So far their portfolio includes excellent examples like these:</p>
<p>*  The [Budget<br />
    calendar](http://www.budgetstories.md/anul-bugetar-2013/), which enables<br />
    citizens to track and learn about the budget approval process for<br />
    2012 - 2014 as an interactive module, including the documents which<br />
    need to be published at each stage of the budget process.<br />
*  An OpenSpending budget treemap, added in order to provide a meaningful<br />
    visualization of the [annual<br />
    proposal](http://www.budgetstories.md/afla-cat-ne-a-costat-parlamentul-in-2012/)<br />
*  A visualisation of the [agricultural subsidy<br />
    program](http://www.budgetstories.md/subventiile-pentru-agricultura-in-2012-pentru-ce-cui-si-unde-au-fost-alocate/).</p>
<p>## Community challenges</p>
<p><strong>Engaging CSOs in spending data:</strong> According to Expert Grup civil society<br />
(NGOs, journalists, and universities) has until now shown little<br />
knowledge of or interest in the existence of open data. The goal has<br />
therefore been to engage with and educate journalists and policymakers.<br />
The main site was launched in February and gave journalists access to cleaned data sets and visualisations for the first time<br />
journalists, as well as<br />
encouraging their republishing and reuse in the public. The aim would be<br />
to gain increased public attention to inefficiencies identified in<br />
government spending and establish connections to more stakeholders. The<br />
results of the outreach are still being assessed.</p>
