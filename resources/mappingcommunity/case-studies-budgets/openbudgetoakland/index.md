<div class="well">Project: <a href="http://openbudgetoakland.org/">OpenBudgetOakland</a>, launched<br />
April 2013.</div>
<p>Open Budget Oakland is a group of civic hackers working on budget<br />
issues. At the beginning of 2013, they initiated the idea<br />
of launching a budget visualization site, with the goal to increase<br />
participation from citizens and stimulate citizen debate around the<br />
city budget. The platform should enable citizens to explore budget<br />
nuances, to discuss the implications of policy decisions, and to ask informed questions, and it should<br />
facilitate information flow from experts in the field to interested citizens.</p>
<p>In February 2013, Open Budget Oakland connected with OpenSpending in<br />
order to plan the launch of [OpenBudgetOakland.org](http://openbudgetoakland.org/).<br />
From February and up until April, the small team worked to complete the<br />
app and launch it in time for the Mayor’s annual release of the budget<br />
proposal for 2013-2015. The team succeeded launching the visualization<br />
of the proposed budget on the day of its release. Shortly after the<br />
launch, the project gained recognition from the City of Oakland as it was<br />
offered to [present the project at city<br />
hall](https://twitter.com/openbudgetOAK/status/329667951265472512/photo/1).</p>

<p>## Technological setup and challenges</p>
<p>The first budget of Oakland was accessed in July 2012 as a 350-page<br />
PDF file, which was copy-pasted into a coherent spreadsheet and an<br />
almost-interactive pie chart at a<br />
[one-day](http://codeforoakland.org/meet-our-2012-winning-apps) hackathon.<br />
The process led directly to this conclusion:<br />
>“accessing Oakland city budget data isn’t easy, and even once you have data, it isn’t<br />
> immediately clear how it can be shared in a way that helps people.”</p>
<p>The small volunteer team at Open Budget Oakland built the site within a<br />
few months of 2013 based on OpenSpending technology, adding two new<br />
distinct features. From March 2013, OpenOakland engaged several email<br />
conversations on the OpenSpending mailing lists and received<br />
contributions via GitHub from OpenSpending developers:</p>
<p>1.  a [Disqus](http://disqus.com/) commenting module, which enables<br />
    users to discuss each spending item and thus improve participation<br />
2.  a browsing feature for the OpenSpending histogram view, enabling<br />
    easier navigation in OpenSpending<br />
3.  [D3](http://d3js.org) for visualising income and expenditure in one<br />
    chart [budget visualisation<br />
    developed](http://www.peterkrantz.com/2012/data-visualization-tools/) developed<br />
    by Peter Krantz, another OpenSpending community member</p>
<p>Open Budget Oakland has also considered the possibility of pursuing<br />
transactional spending data, though this is not available at the moment<br />
from the Oakland City Council.</p>
<p>## Community</p>
<p>The community is considered key for generating a budget discussion going<br />
forward past the initial media coverage.</p>
<p>Open Budget Oakland is a part of Open Oakland, which has a volunteer<br />
team of 21 members working across the entire open government agenda. The<br />
group organises weekly meetups for volunteers and is supported by Code<br />
for America.</p>
