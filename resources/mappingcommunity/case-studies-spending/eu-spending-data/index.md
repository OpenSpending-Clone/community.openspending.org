<div class="well">This segment is based on a community call organised on 18 February<br />
2013 with<br />
additional input from <a href="https://twitter.com/ronpatz">Ronny Patz</a>,<br />

<p>European spending programmes have been undergoing increased scrutiny<br />
among journalists and CSOs in recent years. In this section, we will examine the<br />
access to data from the EU structural funds as well as the EU Commission<br />
spending through the Financial Transparency System (FTS) and discuss<br />
what actors are involved in data-driven analysis and campaigning<br />
around this data.</p>
<p>## Structural funds</p>
<p>Following the Common Agricultural Policy, which has been covered by<br />
[Farmsubsidy.org](../farmsubsidy/), data from the structural funds have<br />
been considered the most important spending data by both journalists and CSOs. In 2010, the Financial Times and the Bureau of<br />
Investigative Journalism published a project including an extensive<br />
database [mapping the structural<br />
funds](http://datajournalismhandbook.org/1.0/en/case_studies_1.html) across<br />
the 2007-2013 EU budget ([more info](http://blog.okfn.org/2011/03/08/a-kafkaesque-data-trail-the-hunt-for-europes-hidden-billions/)).<br />
The project was rightly heralded as<br />
groundbreaking for its level of detail and dedication and its cross-border<br />
setup. Three years later, however, it is also clear that such centrally<br />
initiated projects have limitations, and therefore challenges<br />
remain when thinking about Europe-wide spending transparency.</p>
<p>### Data issues</p>
<p>The FT-TBIJ structural funds investigation exposed a series of barriers<br />
which limit the use of structural funds for CSOs and journalists:</p>
<p>*  Poor data quality</p>
<p>*  Lack of access to data in machine-readable formats; in practise, data<br />
    is often published as PDF, since no format for spending data has<br />
    been specified in EU regulation</p>
<p>*  A dispersed model of distribution across regions in Europe from<br />
    dozens of local sites without a centralised European clearinghouse</p>
<p>### Community challenges</p>
<p>We’ve identified a few important points, which should be noted from the<br />
project:</p>
<p>*  **Media outlets are unlikely to build and sustain long-term data<br />
    projects**. Though the project provided a unique insight into<br />
    structural funds, it was not the intention of the publishers to<br />
    develop a long-term model for tracing and publishing  structural<br />
    fund payments. Though non-profit media institutions do offer a few<br />
    [important exceptions](http://projects.propublica.org/docdollars/),<br />
    we also know that maintaining databases is costly and is widely<br />
    considered to provide too little value for ongoing beat journalism inside<br />
    newsrooms.<br />
*  **CSOs have not addressed systemic needs for data**. Despite receiving<br />
    wide recognition from CSOs regarding the importance of the FT-TBIJ<br />
    structural funds investigation, the European CSO community has<br />
    remained unable to address the need for continuous data flows and<br />
    analytical capacity. Several CSOs do, however, provide extensive<br />
    coverage of European data across topics like FOI ([AccessInfo](http://www.access-info.org)),<br />
    lobbyism ([Corporate Europe](http://corporateeurope.org), [Alter-EU](http://www.alter-eu.org)) and the green economy<br />
    ([Bankwatch](http://bankwatch.org), [Friends of the Earth](http://foei.org)).<br />
*  **Improvements in access to data seem still to be largely supply-driven**. There are national governmental initiatives addressing the<br />
    lack of access to spending data such as [Open<br />
    Coesione](http://www.opencoesione.gov.it/) from the Italian<br />
    government (launched summer 2012), which publishes data on Italian<br />
    structural funds from 450,000 development projects worth € 33.4<br />
    billion. Project Lead [Luigi Reggi](http://luigireggi.eu) is<br />
    regularly engaging with data journalists and the wider public<br />
    through open data events and social media.</p>
<p>[Luigi Reggi](http://luigireggi.eu) has also mapped the accessibility of<br />
EU structural funds data across the EU.</p>

<p>## Future perspectives</p>
<p>The data from the EU structural funds is an example where CSOs and media<br />
outlets are still falling short of the potential of covering already-available spending data in individual countries as well as across<br />
borders.</p>
<p>At this moment, there seems to be no clear political momentum within the<br />
EU for requiring data from the structural funds to be published at a<br />
central site (eg. on the European Data Portal).</p>
<p>New rules will, however, mandate publishing of structural fund data<br />
according to certain dimensions or fields, which provides a small step in<br />
the right direction ([page<br />
157](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2012:0496:FIN:EN:PDF))</p>
<p>## Financial Transparency System (FTS)</p>
<p>Spending reported under the FTS consists of both [EU Commission spending<br />
and grant funding](http://community.openspending.org/research/eu/) provided to<br />
programmes such as research, education, and foreign aid. This is likely the best documented part of the EU budget, though it is not transactional spending data, as it only provides project funding data<br />
and not actual transactions from either EU agencies nor project recipients.</p>
<p>An increase in the minimum threshold is under consideration,<br />
however, which would cause a decrease in access to a substantial amount of<br />
payments.</p>
