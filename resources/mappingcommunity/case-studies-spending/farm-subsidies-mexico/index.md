<div class="well">Project: <a href="http://subsidiosalcampo.org.mx/">Farm subsidy database for Mexico</a> by <a href="http://www.fundar.org.mx/">Fundar</a></div>
<p>## About the project:</p>
<p>Fundar joined with two other organisations including University of<br />
California of Santa Cruz to build the first farm subsidy database in<br />
Mexico. Fundar received some technical assistance from the Environmental<br />
Working Group, which operates the US farm subsidy database. </p>
<p>Currently Fundar is planning to relaunch the database with a new interface and new<br />
features. One part time consultant and 2 developers work on the database<br />
which is strongly prioritised by the organisation.</p>
<p>## Experiences </p>
<p>The farm subsidy database has seen substantial use from journalists<br />
using the various search functionalities. During the last federal<br />
electionÂ the database became an important source for both local and<br />
national media outlets for monitoring politicians. </p>
<p>Collaboration between communities working on farm subsidies in Mexico, USA and Europe could be explored in order to share experiences on how to create useful tools for displaying and analysing farm subsidy data.</p>
