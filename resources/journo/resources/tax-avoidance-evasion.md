<h3>Tax evasion and avoidance</h3>
Tax avoidance/evasion
=====================

<p>This resource was originally designed as an exercise in journalistic judgement run at an <a href="http://blog.okfn.org/2012/11/14/data-expeditions-at-mozfest/">open day</a>, but it's a resource to facilitate many investigations into money lost from tax.</p> 

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/object-group/8368409648/sizes/n/in/photostream/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8184/8368409648_92d093db30.jpg" alt="data expedition"></a>

<p>I should add straight away that there is no correct answer to this exercise - it simply offers a number of routes to investigating taxation - all routes have a dataset so the resulting story is really a reflection of the morality and motivations of the journalist rather than available resources.</p>  
 
<p> The first choice you face in this tax investigation is to pursue tax avoidance (currently legal but this legality could be challenged) or tax evasion (illegal non payment of tax through non disclosure or non payment).</p>

<p> Choosing the tax avoidance immediately leads you into schemes. The researcher chooses between corporate and personal income tax avoidance.  
 If they choose income tax we describe one aggressive tax avoidance strategy that relies on there being no taxation on loans, and creating a separate organisation based in a tax haven that can receive all the profits and then give an interest free loan that is designed so that it never has to be repaid to the tax avoider. </p>
      
<p> For example an individual avoids paying tax by becoming a contractor to a company in a tax heaven, the individual earns a large salary but this is paid to their agency and the individual is only paid the minimum wage which they pay tax on, they are then given the rest of their earnings as an interest free loan from the agency which they don't pay tax on. </p>  

<p>In this route there are two options, to look at a tax avoidance scheme that some celebrities have used or to look at a scheme that is used for highly paid employees in well known organisations.</p>

<p>The celebrity scheme is the K2. The <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/eim45000.htm">guidance</a> covering this is on the revenue and customs website.</p>
       
<p>The scheme that is used for highly paid employees in well known organisations is the <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/news/ebt-news0812.htm">Employee Benefit Trust schemes</a> in the UK until their use was strongly discouraged.</p>

<p>If these two investigations do not satisfy the desire for a scoop there is a third option for the investigation. Here we aim to get the people using these schemes. </p>

<p>This involves putting together pieces of the tax avoidance picture. </p>

<p>We can get some sense of how frequently these schemes are used, or how much money is saved as some country's tax collection forms require the tax avoided by individuals (or lost from the system) as some countries require taxpayers to describe their scheme - in the UK DOTAS does this and there are stats <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/avoidance/avoidance-disclosure-statistics.htm">here</a>.</p>
        
<p>And some explantation of DOTAS is <a href="http://www.rossmartin.co.uk/index.php/penalties-a-compliance/403-disclosure-of-tax-avoidance-schemes-dotas">here</a>.</p>

<p>This narrows down which schemes are most used. Then we can figure out which tax havens are most likely to be used as the <a href="http://www.oecd.org/ctp/harmfultaxpractices/listofunco-operativetaxhavens.htm">oecd monitors heavens</a> and attempts to get transparency in tax heavens.</p>

<p>So once you get down to a country and a tax avoidance scheme we can start looking for agencies that are set up there.</p>  

<p>There are groups who set up schemes and there are their customers and there are the people or companies who benefit.</p> 

<p>If the investigator selects the tax avoidance for corporations option they will be looking at transfer pricing. This is the strategy of having smaller companies within the same corporate empire. The smaller companies can be based in tax heavens and each operate in a way that is maximally tax efficient to the empire overall. This is particularly common in online retail.</p>

<p>So an online book retailer might have a company specifically for its book sales based in Luxembourg and so pays a Luxembourg VAT rate (only 3%), but the books are bought all over the world.</p>  

<p>The challenge here is to explain this for a company. Pick one of Starbucks, Amazon or Google and take a look at the <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmselect/cmpubacc/writev/716/contents.htm">written evidence</a> for their involvement in the UK. Use this a basis for an explanation of their specific tax avoidance mechanism.</p>

<p>Alternatively if the researcher is interested in ways that tax avoidance may be managed they are recommended to investigate the General Anti-Abuse Rule (GAAR) that is being developed at the moment <a href="http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/tax_avoidance_gaar.htm">here</a>. The rule aims to deter abusive tax avoidance by reducing legal uncertainty around what constitutes aggressive tax evasion and what constitutes legitimate tax planning. </p>
         
<p>If the investigators selection was tax evasion rather than tax avoidance then they choose the severity of the evasion ranging from shadow market evasion that covers cash in hand payments, to individuals evading tax and wanted by the tax authorities.</p> 

<p>If the investigator selects the size of the shadow market their challenge is to collate and compare different estimates of the size of the shadow market in a wide range of countries. The reports with estimates we suggest are from <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/europe2020/pdf/themes/06_shadow_economy.pdf">the European Commission</a> and the <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2012/wp1247.pdf">IMF</a> but other sources should be added. </p>

<p>The individuals considered to be evading tax and with a warrant was issued by a UK court and that are being investigated by the UK tax authority are fully described on the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hmrcgovuk/sets/72157631087785530/">official HMRC account</a>. The challenge is to classify these for example as importing goods without paying UK tax and fraudulently claiming state benefits etc. Then to put these individual costs in the context of cost estimates for these crimes in the country as a whole. For example we can get overall cost of benefit fraud <a href="http://research.dwp.gov.uk/asd/asd2/index.php?page=fraud_error">here</a> and the loss of funds through importing goods without paying tax from this <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/research/direct-tax-gaps.pdf">HMRC report on tax gaps</a>.</p>

<p> That is all possible routes for this little exercise in tax reporting. Let us know what you investigate or how it goes if you use this as the basis for a training day. Ideally on the <a href="http://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/openspending">open spending mailing list</a>. </p>
