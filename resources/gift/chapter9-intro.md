## Final Observations and Review


While this report demonstrates possible ways in which technology can contribute to fiscal transparency it should also be clear that technology is not a magic potion that will automatically resolve all barriers to fiscal transparency. 


The authors of this report were tasked with highlighting ‘cutting edge’ technology for fiscal transparency. While we have attempted to do so and to show some of the very best and most sophisticated work in this sphere , we would like to emphasise that simple solutions often yield the best results. 


In delivering on fiscal transparency, a combination of online and offline, technical and non-technical approaches will be required. In some cases, technology will be neither necessary nor appropriate: e.g. in participatory budgeting it will be crucial to engage citizens offline if the process is to be effective. In other cases, prioritising ICT over offline methods can lead to exclusion for poor and marginalised groups who have little access to the internet or low literacy levels. 


Nevertheless, the examples highlighted here do show that technology can be a very effective complement to existing processes in enhancing fiscal processes and transparency. These tools can work on numerous levels simultaneously, reducing barriers to participation and reaching out to groups who would otherwise not have the chance to participate. 


We have already highlighted specific recommendations in individual sections, and here we would like to pull together some of the most important. The report demonstrates that many actors need to be involved  in order to promote fiscal transparency: 


Below are numerous recommendations related to the role of all parties including governments, civil society organisations and multi-stakeholder initiatives such as GIFT. 


### All Parties: 

* Work towards a simple standard for spending data (see attached TOR) 

### Governments: 


* Promote the use of simple, machine-readable formats which can significantly increase the usefulness of data 
* Make sure that all fiscal data is released under a proper open license (i.e. one that conforms to http://OpenDefinition.org/)
* Support and partner with civil society projects to assess whether existing, open-source tools will serve the purpose desired, before looking to create new ones
* Organise structured feedback mechanisms and make sure teams within governments have the resources to deal with potentially large volumes of feedback 
* Crowdsource Problem Areas: Providing mechanisms for citizens to give feedback on problems as they experience them. Once an area of concern is identified e.g a particular department is  frequently flagged up as asking for bribes when issuing licences, the government would know to investigate further.
* Make sure technology does not become a substitute for face-to-face contact. Many important parts of the PB process happen offline. Technology is a useful complement to offline channels of communication and participation, but is not a substitute.
* Examine structured data formats for drafting legislation and tabling amendments


### Technical Specialists 
 
* Look into ways to make it easier for governments to make data available from the data management systems they already work with - do they have APIs? can they easily pull out reports from their accounting system (e.g. an ‘export report for press’ option)? 

### Civil Society Organisations & Private Sector


* Re-publish data they have derived and added value to. 
* Work on capacity building and data literacy: Are all necessary skills being fostered to maintain technical solutions? For example, is an intern relied on to load new data or do all members of staff know the standards and processes required to do it? 

### Foundations

* Many of the projects highlighted in this report are one-off solutions, tailored to an individual local problem. Funders may like to review existing projects (e.g. those listed in the appendix & in the participatory budgeting software census, and on sites such as the [Civic Commons Marketplace](http://civiccommons.org/apps)), to see whether any existing open-source solutions could be adapted to serve other or more general problems, before initiating another.
* Support platforms (as well as individual instances of a piece of software) which allow solutions to be scaled, promote inter-organisational data-sharing and communities of practice. 
* Collect resources for long-term archives of data and documents relating to fiscal activities. 

### GIFT:

* Make use of the GIFT address book and further extend it. Many of the groups highlighted in this report and participating in working groups have specific areas of expertise in this large and intricate sphere. These groups can help to identify further gaps where specific types of information are missing. 
* Keep looking for projects working in this area and connecting people. To our knowledge, there is no comprehensive central database of all transparency and accountability initiatives using technology to promote fiscal transparency as well as NGOs working in this field. The appendix at the end of this report represents a start, but a larger-scale, community effort will be required to keep this up to date. 
* Keep talking. Consider a role for a Global Financial Transparency Coordinator. During this research, we spent a lot of time organising meetings. We need to make sure these important discussions continue to take place and the networks continue to be built. 
* Bringing together government officials who have previously implemented technical solutions, e.g. to participatory budgeting, to share experiences and review software tools
* Based on the feedback from this, refine and upkeep a online, collaborative catalogue of options which can guide governments about existing solutions and experiences. Draw on advice from expert groups in participatory budgeting such as the PB Unit or the Participatory Budgeting Project.
