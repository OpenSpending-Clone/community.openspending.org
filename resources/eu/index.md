<td align="left"><p>The EU Budget in Numbers</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>The EU has committed to spending over €959,988 billion over the period 2014-2020.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The EU budget is divided into more than 80 funds and programmes.</li>
<li>Five of these funds, the European Structural and Investments Funds (ESIF), represent 33% of the total budget.</li>
<li>Around 6% of the budget goes to the administration of the European institutions, whereas around 94% is allocated to various European programmes.</li>
<li>There are more than 100 authorities managing EU funds. 20% of these are managed directly by the European Commission. The remaining 80% are managed by other authorities.</li>

Recent polls show that European citizens hold the EU to be inaccessible due to its complexity and lack of transparency.[^ftnt1] The lack of transparency and democratic accountability in European institutions is widely characterised as a “[democratic deficit](http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/glossary/democratic_deficit_en.htm)”, a phrase which has become part of the EU’s official glossary. This “democratic deficit” is particularly apparent when it comes to EU public finances.

This guide aims to help civil society organisations (CSOs), journalists and others to navigate the vast landscape of documents and datasets about the EU’s fiscal affairs. In doing so, our objective is to support more evidence-based journalism and advocacy, and - in the longer term - to contribute towards the transparency, public understanding and democratic accountability of EU public finances.

The level of transparency about EU public money is highly variable, and is largely dependent on which authority is responsible for managing and disbursing a given fund. Funds which are exemplary for their transparency exist alongside funds which are effectively dark. For example, on one hand, the Financial Transparency System (FTS) set up by the European Commission provides access to granular open data about spending, but only concerns about 20% of total spending. On the other hand, information about public money spent by EU Members States is often unavailable to the public.

The European Union has now entered into a new budget framework for 2014-2020. This is accompanied by a new financial regulation, defining new funds and new transparency rules. However, as we shall see in this report, many barriers still remain. In addition to providing an overview of key funds and programmes, we also conclude with some analysis and recommendations for further work in this area.

<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left"><h2>Summary of Recommendations</h2>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li>Establish a single central point of reference for data and documents about EU revenue, budgeting and expenditure and ensure all the information is up to date  at this domain (e.g. at a website such as <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fec.europa.eu%2Fbudget&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFWcyA9aOiTTUegt8YVevYXpnkn0Q">ec.europa.eu/budget</a>). In the same time, ensure all EU Budget data are available from the EU open data portal as open data.</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Create an open dataset with key details about each EU fund, including name of the fund, heading, policy, type of management, implementing authorities, link to information on beneficiaries.</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Extend the Financial Transparency System to all EU funds by integrating or federating detailed data expenditures from Members States, non-EU Members and international organisations. Data on beneficiaries should include, when relevant, a unique European identifier of company, and when the project is co-financed, the exact amount of EU funding received and the total amount of the project.</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Clarify and harmonise the legal framework regarding transparency rules for the beneficiaries of EU funds.</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Support and strengthen funding for civil society groups and journalists working on EU public finances.</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Conduct a more detailed assessment of beneficiary data availability for all EU funds and for all implementing authorities - e.g., through a dedicated “open data audit”.</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<ol start="7">
<li>Build a stronger central base of evidence about the uses and users of EU fiscal data - including data projects, investigative journalism projects and data users in the media and civil society.</li>
</ol>

[^ftnt13]: As the UK rebate, lump sum payments and reduced VAT call rates are correction mechanisms, that is to say measures taken to compensate Member States whose contribution to the EU budget is perceived as being too high compared to their relative wealth and the benefits they get out of the EU budget.

[^ftnt18]: [European Commission ESIF webpage.](http://ec.europa.eu/contracts_grants/funds_en.htm)

[^ftnt19]: Initial amount was €74 928 million but in accordance with regulation 1303/2013 (art. 92(6) and 92(7)), parts of this amount have been transferred to the Connecting Europe Facility and to the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived.

[^ftnt20]: For example, concerning the exact amount of the five ESIF for the 2014-2020 period, one EU publication mentions a number of [366.9 billion euros](http://ec.europa.eu/contracts_grants/pdf/synergies_beneficiaries_en.pdf) whereas another one makes reference to a total of [351.8 billion euros](http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/sources/docgener/panorama/pdf/mag48/mag48_en.pdf).

[^ftnt21]: It should be noted, however, that DG BUDGET, the EU Directorate-General for Budget, was quite responsive to the requests for information sent by the authors of the report through social medias such as Twitter.

[^ftnt22]: The Directive  2012/17/EU introduces a unique identifier for European companies. However, there is no provision for that unique identifier to be used in data on EU funds beneficiaries. See [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32012L0017](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32012L0017)
