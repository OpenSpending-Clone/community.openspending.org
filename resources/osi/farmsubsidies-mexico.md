# Farm subsidies in Mexico

Project:[Farm subsidy database for Mexico](http://subsidiosalcampo.org.mx/) from
[Fundar](http://www.fundar.org.mx/)

About the project:

Fundar joined with two other organisations including University of
California of Santa Cruz to build the first farm subsidy database in
Mexico. Fundar received some technical assistance from the Environmental
Working Group, which operates the US farm subsidy database. 

Currently Fundar is planning to relaunch the database with a new interface and new
features. One part time consultant and 2 developers work on the database
with significant support from the director.

Experiences: The farm subsidy database has seen use from journalists
for its search functionality. During the most recent federal
electionÂ the database became an important source for both local and
national media outlets for monitoring politicians. 

Collaboration between communities working on farm subsidies in Mexico, USA and Europe could be explored in order to share experiences on how to create useful tools for displaying and analysing farm subsidy data
