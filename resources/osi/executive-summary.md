# Highlights

## Status Quo 

### Demand for data 

It is clear and undeniable that there is an unquenched demand for financial data about governments from Civil Society. In particular, for data on:

<ul>
	<li><strong>Budgets</strong></li>
	<li>Spending - crucially, at <strong> transaction level</strong></li>  
	<li> Procurement</li>
	<li><a href="http://openspending.org/resources/osi/other-handy-datasets.html">Other Useful Datasets</a></li>
</ul>

This should be:
* proactively released 
* [machine readable](machinereadfaq.html).
* Available at international (e.g. EU farm subsisides), national and local levels.

It should also be stated that no amount of proactive release can replace the need for Freedom of Information requests, which remain of prime importance. 

### Key Obstacles in Preventing Re-use of the Data

The following should be avoided at all costs when publishing government financial data.

* Absence of bulk download option
* CAPTCHA codes preventing automated download
* Publishing data in HTML or PDFs
* Aritrary release thresholds - without transparency about how they were decided

### Common vocabulary and language barriers

Two of the most common words which frame this debate *open* and *standard*, are used differently in policy and technical spheres -two key proponents of the transparency movement. This often leads to conversations happening at cross-purposes and hinders communication across the community.

		<td><strong>Policy Sphere Usage</strong></td>
	</tr>
	<tr><td>Open</td>
		<td>Free to use, reuse and redistribute - subject only, at most, to the requirement to attribute and/or share-alike. (See <a href="http://opendefinition.org/">The Open Definition</a>).</td>
		<td>Publicy available and accessible.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr><td>Standard</td>
		<td>A technical specification for code or data. For example, <a href="http://openspending.org/resources/standard/index.html">the draft spending standard</a> by the Spending Data Community.
		<td>Best practice guidelines for a particular behaviour, or benchmarks.</td>

### When it comes to publishing standards- there are clear role-models to follow

We regularly heard phrases such as “I want procurement data like Slovakia” or “How did you convince the UK government to release transaction-level spending?”. While we acknowledge that there is still work to be done on both accounts, such examples should be seen as the forefront of open data policies, and used as examples to help civil society initiatives demand more from their own countries.

### Offering civil-society-led, free technical help to governments may promote transparency

For example, in Slovenia the [Supervizor site](https://www.kpk-rs.si/en/project-transparency/supervizor-73) seems to have been driven by a combination of a strong independent anti-corruption commission and access to pro-bono development resources to prototype and develop the models.
