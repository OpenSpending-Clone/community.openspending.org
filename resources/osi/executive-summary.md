# Executive Summary 

## Status Quo 

### Demand for data 

It is clear and undeniable that there is an unquenched demand for financial data about governments from Civil Society. In particular, for data on:

<ul>
	<li><strong>Budgets</strong></li>
	<li>Spending - crucially, at <strong> transaction level</strong></li>  
	<li> Procurement</li>
</ul>

This should be:
* *[machine readable](machinereadfaq.html)*.
* Available at international (e.g. EU farm subsisides), national and local levels.

### Key Obstacles in Preventing Re-use of the Data

The following should be avoided at all costs when publishing government financial data.

* Absence of bulk download option
* CAPTCHA codes preventing automated download
* Publishing data in HTML or PDFs
* Aritrary release thresholds - without transparency about how they were decided

### Common vocabulary and language barriers

Two of the most common words which frame this debate *open* and *standard*, are used differently in policy and technical spheres -two key proponents of the transparency movement. This often leads to conversations happening at cross-purposes.

	<tr>
		<td><strong>Term</strong></td>
		<td><strong>Open Data / Technical Community Usage</strong></td>
		<td><strong>Policy Sphere Usage</strong></td>
	</tr>
	<tr><td>Open</td>
		<td>Free to use, reuse and redistribute - subject only, at most, to the requirement to attribute and/or share-alike. (See <a href="http://opendefinition.org/">The Open Definition</a>).</td>
		<td>Publicy available and accessible.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr><td>Standard</td>
		<td>A technical specification for code or data. For example, <a href="http://openspending.org/resources/standard/index.html">the draft spending standard</a> by the Spending Data Community.
		<td>Best practice guidelines for a particular behaviour, or benchmarks.</td>
