# Athens to Berlin: Video Series

As part of the research for this project, we travelled from [Athens to Berlin](http://openspending.org/blog/2012/07/05/OSI.html) to conduct a series of interviews with Civil Society Organisations across Europe. We were interested to know whether everyone suffered from similar problems in using the data - or whether some countries had a far easier time using the data. We found both statements to be true... 

Part 1: Introductions to the Organisations
