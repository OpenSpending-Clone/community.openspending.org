# Case Studies - Spending
<br>
The past few years organisations and journalists have, through FOI requests and open data agendas, addressed the need for granular transactional spending data. Meanwhile we have seen countries which have released spending data without much public attention. In the following case studies we examine how spending data can be used to strengthen local community participation as well as increase accountability of some of the biggest spending programmes in the EU.

The cases also deals with the challenges of enhancing uptake among community members and journalists when the complexity and scale of the becomes clear.
