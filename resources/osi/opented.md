#OpenTED, Opening Tender Electronic Daily
This post reviews how OpenTED and OpenSpending has worked to make procurement data from the EU site, Tender Electronic Daily available as CSV download. More than 100,000 public sector contracts are published annually in the  European procurement register originating from tiny municipalities to large government agencies. 

##Why open up EU procurement data?
TED contains procurement data on contracts awarded from any public agency within the EU valued above the minimum threshold at EUR 200,000. In most EU countries granular data from contract awards therefore comprises a significant share of procured and projected spending. 
It is an often overlooked fact that EU procurement rules apply to all majority publicly owned companies. For this reason the public can for instance access data on more than 500 contracts awarded by the Swedish state-owned Vattenfall in all EU countries of operation, such as this contract awarded from their Berlin based company, due to the fact that it is majority owned by the Swedish state.

##Project and issues
As the TED database is not available as bulk download and so in 2011 a small data journalism project OpenTED began exploring the options for scraping the data in order to make it available in open format. In November 2012 and May 2013 this was explored further through community hack days in London and Brussels organised by OKF, where data was retrieved, parsed and cleaned. The full TED data set is now available and can be accessed as CSV files EU wide or on a country by country basis. 

Following the publication of the TED data several challenges remain:
- While the TED data is by now available as CSV downloads, additional data cleaning is still needed
- There is a substantial need for engaging CSOs and journalists in making sense of the data and finding relevant user stories
- A review of the data quality is needed in order to get a clear picture of the state of the TED-data and help assess how useful it will be for journalists and researchers
- As procurement data is increasingly becoming available in more countries such as Senegal, Ukraine and Australia it has become increasingly more relevant to consider if procurement data should have a more clear place on OpenSpending.
