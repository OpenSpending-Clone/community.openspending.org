From our research we have found that procurement data in several countries is serving an important purpose for promoting financial transparency, in particular by filling in the blanks when transactional spending data is not available. For example most EU countries have yet to publish transactional spending data (exceptions:United Kingdom and Slovenia).

When looking at public agencies outside government such as regions or municipalities, where a sizeable share of government spending is being executed, access to transactional spending data is equally uncommon.

Finally, journalists and civil society organisations can use procurement databases to identify individual contracts, which tells the stories on questionable awarding practices.

Global initiatives such as OpenContracting of the World Bank Institute and more recently the procurement initiative of the Sunlight Foundation confirm that momentum is growing to promote transparency in procurement.

The case studies in this section show that accessing and analysing procurement data can provide substantial improvements to the state of financial transparency, but also that data formats, data quality and disclosure policies remain barriers for utilizing the full potential from procurement data.

As procurement data is increasingly becoming available in more countries such as Senegal, Ukraine and Australia it has become increasingly more relevant to consider if procurement data should have a clear place on OpenSpending. This question is therefore explored by the community at the moment.
