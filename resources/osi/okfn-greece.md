# OKFN Greece

Project: Tracing financial reporting from the Cl@rity program

This project review is based on the detailed review of Thodoris
Papadopoulos, Open Knowledge Foundation Local Group.

Summary: OKFN Greece is monitoring the financial reporting systems in
Greece thoroughly during the crisis, resulting in detailed reviews of
the rapid legal and technical changes, which the Greek financial
reporting system has undergone the last few years ultimately leading to
several proposals for technical changes to the reporting standards.

About the project:

In Greece the most important piece of legislation in recent years
regarding the transparency of government action is the “Clarity”
program, which introduced the obligation to publish all the decisions of
government and all administrative entities on the Internet.
[“Cl@rity”](http://diavgeia.gov.gr/) aims to generate maximum
accessibility of government policy and administrative actions. Since the
programme was launched in October 2010, almost 6 million administrative
decisions have been uploaded to the cl@rity website, with a daily
average of 14,000 decisions.

With the Cl@rity program, the enforceability of any administrative act
presupposes a previous announcement on the internet. Furthermore,
cl@rity provides an open data API in XML and JSON formats through which
everyone can have structured access to all decisions, along with their
metadata, ensuring openness and further dissemination of public
information.

The cl@rity initiative has already already a silent however significant
effect on the way authorities handles their executive power. It leaves
considerably less room for corruption, and exposes it much more easily
when it takes place, since any citizen or interested party can openly
access any questionable acts. This is a scheme of “collective scrutiny”
that can be effective, since it allows citizens directly involved or
concerned with an issue to scrutinize it in depth, rather than leaving
it to the traditional media, whose choice of issues often is restricted
and oriented towards “safe” topics

## Identified challenges

Although, Cl@rity was not designed with financial monitoring in mind, it
includes various decision types that includes various financial metadata
(such as Expenditure, Budget, and Contract data). From the onset however
the Cl@rity programme however suffered from issues of poor data quality
such as the:

1.  Failure to provide the hierarchy of entities
2.  Lack of validation rules for metadata fields and non mandatory
    requirements

In reality these issues prevented citizens and journalists from
utilizing the full potential of the Cl@rity program as a platform for
public financial data.

## Project results

OKFN Greece highlights two major achievements from their data quality
review and proposals:

1.  For the CL@rity programme substantial improvements have been
    implemented by the end of 2012. These corrections included changes
    of significant importance to journalists and CSOs such as improving
    the data quality of the transactional spending amounts.
2.  For a supplementary information system to support the cl@rity
    program several suggestions brought forward by OKFN-Greece have been
    admitted to the data architecture. The new system will for this
    reason be more responsive and accurate, and provide a more detailed
    data model with many more metadata fields. The new system is
    expected to be delivered by the end of 2013. The owner of the system
    the [Greek Ministry of Administrative Reform and
    e-Governance](http://www.ydmed.gov.gr/) has undertaken to provide
    the source code of the system through the [European Open Source
    Observatory and
    Repository](http://joinup.ec.europa.eu/community/osor/description) under
    a [EUPL](http://joinup.ec.europa.eu/software/page/eupl) licence.
