# Expert Grup

Project: Budgetstories, Moldova

In mid 2012, Expert Grup began to work to make sense of huge budget
datasets. In November 2012, while finalizing the project concept,
members of the organising team took part in the [Balkan Budget
Workshop](http://openspending.org/blog/2012/11/26/Sarajevo-Workshop-Writeup.html) organised by the OpenSpending team.

About the team: The core BudgetStories.md team at the Expert-Grup
consists of 3 core staff members: the project director, one project
communication and analytical expert, with one additional analytic expert
as support. The implementation was made with an external web design
company who executed the website based on input from the team. The web
company had a total of 5 people in total working on BudgetStories.md (2
designers, 2 developers and 1 project manager)

Expert Grup has introduced several projects using open budget and
spending data. The main challenges pointed out have related around
accessing data, cleaning the data (using Excel), and managing the data
visualisation work, which was done by an an external web agency. Most of
the needed data was available to the public on
[data.gov.md](http://data.gov.md/) and in the World Banks [BOOST data
tool](http://www.mf.gov.md/ro/BOOST/), and government agencies were open
to provide direct requests for data requested in a timely manner. The
data was analysed with Excel. During the research Expert Grup used the
Spending Data Handbook, the Open Data Handbook and the Data Journalism
Handbook as resources:

> “It was really helpful to learn about data formats. It is the equivalent
> of a data literacy 101 class.”

## Technical challenges

Presenting the data: “It is still a challenge for us to make
visualizations meaningful. We plan to improve with every infographic we
publish.” Expert Grup is planning to work more on developing their
presentations of their data. Most of their visualisations have been
developed by a web agency based on the directions from Expert Grup. One
exception is the visualisation of the [Moldava
budget](http://www.budgetstories.md/bugetul-2013/), which was done with
OpenSpending treemaps by Expert Grup.

In the future Expert Grup wil be looking to expand their work: “There is
still a lot of work to be done. We have until now published three data
visualizations.”

So far their portfolio include excellent examples such as:

1.  The [Budget
    calendar](http://www.budgetstories.md/anul-bugetar-2013/) enabling
    citizens to track and learn about the budget approval process for
    2012 - 2014 as an interactive module, including the documents which
    need to be published at each stage of the budget process.
2.  An OpenSpending budget tree map added in order to provide a
    [meaningful visualisation of the annual
    proposal](http://www.budgetstories.md/afla-cat-ne-a-costat-parlamentul-in-2012/)
3.  A visualisation of the [agricultural subsidy
    program](http://www.budgetstories.md/subventiile-pentru-agricultura-in-2012-pentru-ce-cui-si-unde-au-fost-alocate/).

## Community challenges

Engaging CSOs in spending data: According to Expert Grup civil society
(NGOs, journalists and universities) has until now shown little
knowledge or interest in the existence of open data. The goal has
therefore been to engage with and educate journalists and policy makers.
The main site was launched in February and enabled for the first time
journalists access to cleaned data sets and visualisations, and
encouraging their republishing and reuse in the public. The aim would be
to gain increased public attention to inefficiencies identified in
government spending and establish connections to more stakeholders. The
results of the outreach are still being assessed.

Bosnia-Herzegovina (Budgets)

After meeting the team from the Public Interest Advocacy Centre (CPI) at
the POINT conference in Sarajevo in 2012, a proposal was launched to
start the Budzeti.ba ([beta version online](http://budzeti.ba/))
project. In November 2012, the project had a kick-off workshop to get
the ball rolling and cover some of the key data-wrangling issues faced
by CSOs wanting to create a budget monitoring site. Some of the topics
we covered were:

1.  An introduction to [DataWrapper](http://datawrapper.de/) for making
    simple charts and web visualisations,
2.  [Kartograph](http://kartograph.org/) for making elegant maps,
3.  Scraping using [ScraperWiki](http://scraperwiki.com/),
4.  Using Optical Character Recognition to get data out of PDFs
5.  Cleaning data using [Google
    Refine](http://code.google.com/p/google-refine/).

Also present at this workshop were the team from Expert Grup in Moldova,
prior to the launch of their Budget Stories project.

The Budzeti.ba project is still in progress and is due for a full launch
in autumn 2013. The aim of the project is to provide a one-stop shop for
budget information in a format which is accessible for citizens.

Several things make this process harder from the point of view of the
re-users of the data:

1.  Countries such as [Bosnia do not publish Citizen’s
    Budgets](http://survey.internationalbudget.org/#profile/BA) in the
    first place - meaning that this classification has to come entirely
    from civil society, leading to worries from the CSO that the
    interpretation of the data may be contested.
2.  Some countries do not group their data by functional
    classifications. This is important as the average citizen is more
    likely to want to know what money is spent on - i.e. what services
    they got in exchange for their tax money, than for example which
    government department is spending the money - which is all it is
    possible to infer from many budgets.
3.  For the purposes of visualisations, such as the OpenSpending ones,
    organisations such as CPI must classify the complex information
    contained in budgets for themselves in a form which is accessible
    and yet not overwhelming for citizens. There are practical
    implications to this, for example - having more than 10 top level
    items in a budget results in a very cramped visualisation (the
    OpenSpending visualisations work best with about ten top level
    items) and there are only so many categories a person can take in at
    any one time. For the purposes of the visualisations, the CPI team
    classified the data in a schema similar to the internationally
    recognised Classifications of Functions of Government, as was used
    in the UK project Where Does My Money Go?

More information about the classification methodology they used can be
found in the post: [Bosnian Budgets - grouping data by categories people
