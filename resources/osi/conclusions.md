# Conclusion
The voices and stories from organisations in this report underline the diversity of the  community working at the intersection of technology and government finances. Here we’ll list some of the key takes from the research, which has allowed us to acquire a deeper understanding of the work that’s being done to advance financial transparency.

## Demand for data

It is impossible to deny that there is demand for open financial data

This report has clearly outlined that there is demand for openly available, open [as per the Open Definition](http://opendefinition.org/) (see next point). This is in particular data about:

<ul>
	<li><strong>Budgets</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Spending</strong> - crucially, at <strong> transaction level</strong></li>
	<li> <strong>Procurement</strong> - includes information on contractual agreements between suppliers and government entities:</li>
		<ul>
			<li> <strong> Contracts </strong> - understood as the documents containing the contractual agreements between public agencies and private companies. These can be important sources for CSOs and journalists when examining the terms of service, fee structures and names of the signatories. Many governments however argue that contracts are commercially confidential as reasoning for only disclosing redacted contracts or not disclosing contract at all. Read more at <a href="http://www.open-contracting.org/">Open Contracting</a>.</li>
			<li><strong>Company Information</strong> - in order to be able to answer questions related to policy and outsourcing decisions, integrity and effectiveness of the contracting process and the track records of companies contracting with governments to name but a few. Further reading - the <a href="http://opencorporates.com/downloads/ogp_company_data_report.pdf">OpenCorporates report</a> on open corporate data in Open Government Partnership Countries.
			<li><strong>Information on people in positions of power, business and family associations </strong> - <em>not</em> information about individual citizens. This is to help understand key questions, “who is responsible for a given political decision?”, “what relationships (family, friend etc) are there between winners of tenders and people within government? (are there any conflicts of interest?)”. (* See note) </li>
			</ul>
</ul>

International (e.g. Farm Subsidies), National - and Local level data is demanded.

<small>* So far, there have been a few well-coordinated attempts to standardise and collect this information biographical information, [Popit from MySociety](http://popit.mysociety.org/) and [Popolo from OpenNorth and the Participatory Politics Foundation](http://blog.opennorth.ca/2013/02/21/update-on-opengovernment/), however - a coordinated international effort is required in order to maintain this enormous, and rapidly evolving dataset. </small>

## Key obstacles preventing re-use of data

### No bulk download

Many governments believe that publishing financial data online (in html or PDF) equals making the data “open”. For this reason many CSOs struggle with the task of scraping content off websites (if they even know it is possible to do so). In the worst cases  - automatic access or scrapers may be impeded by using CAPTCHA codes.

Bulk download is crucial to allow organisations to keep a copy in case information disappears from the internet.

### Governmental PDF release policies

Many organisations have identified PDF releases as a substantial barrier to re-use. Though organisations often manage to complete projects, the governmental policies to release PDFs impedes workflow and increase demand for members with technical skills.

(Further reading to understand which formats are appropriate for publishing financial data: [Appendix: Common arguments against publishing](appendix-open-budgets-open-data.html).

### Privacy Concerns...

are often cited as one of the reasons for not releasing this level of detail in detail, but often needlessly so. Technology and good data-management practices make it possible to develop a workflow, which allows sensitive information to be removed within a government body, prior to publication. A little training may be required within government, but the process is relatively straightforward once a suppression list is built. With Ian Makgill, OpenSpending has developed a thorough guide, which addresses main risks when releasing spending data from local councils. This guide can be found in the appendix.

(Further reading: [How to publish spending data without disclosing personal information](privacyguide.md))

Arbitrary release thresholds

At least two of the countries which release transaction-level data have imposed seemingly arbitrary thresholds on the size of transactions that are included. For example, the US and the UK exclude transactions under $25,000 and 25,000 GBP, respectively.
Are these thresholds appropriate? That can't be known for sure without more information about how these numbers were arrived at. Principally, having thresholds or exceptions to the reporting of this data depends on the underlying systems that drive disclosure of this data. There must either be a publicly stated and rational reason for these disclosure thresholds - or they should be lowered (or ideally, removed entirely).
Read a more detailed explanation of release thresholds in the [Spending Data Handbook](http://openspending.org/resources/handbook/ch006_types-of-data.html)

When open is differently perceived - finding a common vocabulary

While CSOs across topical interests all pursue increased government transparency, we’ve taken note that the community working broadly on financial transparency still miss a common vocabulary for framing an agenda around access to government financial data. This is particularly problematic with regard to the term “open”, which is used to denote in some spheres availability and timeliness, and in the open data community, additional conditions regarding making data usable both technically and legally, for example, the open data community however has articulated the need for accessibility of granular data in usable formats.

There are clear leaders amongst governments regarding publishing practices

During our research, we regularly heard phrases such as “I want procurement data like Slovakia” or “How did you convince the UK government to release transaction-level spending?”. While we acknowledge that there is still work to be done on both accounts, such examples should be seen as the forefront of open data policies, and used as examples to help civil society initiatives demand more from their own countries.

Civil Society organisations could be equipped with these examples, for example, when entering consultations with governments as part of Civil Society Action plans for Open Government Partnership meetings. A lot of effort is currently being dedicated to talking about standards for open government data, and this early benchmarking would enable countries to act independently (and hence more quickly than an international standardisation effort) to open up their data in a usable format. A possible next step is to prepare a toolkit of best practice examples for Civil Society organisations to use in benchmarking and consultations with governments.

We have a unique opportunity while momentum for Open Government is still high, to leverage these examples. Using these examples as part of a consultation model, would mean discussions were held based on practical examples. This would hopefully lead to more concrete, and actionable action plans for the Open Government Partnership, based on real practical examples.


Lack of civil society and journalists (or good spending models doesn’t nessesarily make strong civil societies)

In some countries we find that the supply of government spending data has increased substantially in recent years without having journalists and CSOs making much use of the data.

For example Slovenia today has since 2011 arguably had one of the leading models for publishing government transactions. Yet there seems to have been little uptake among journalists or CSOs. While one reason might clearly be that making sense of large spending datasets requires substantial skills, what the case of Slovenia maybe demonstrates more than anything is that governmental access to data might actually offer little guidance as to how vibrant the civil society on spending transparency actually is. (See next point for counter example).

This is perhaps simply a matter of training, or perhaps a language barrier (transactions in English-speaking countries are already being relatively regularly used.

A few improvements on spending transparency occur for reasons other than public pressure

Some of the recent improvements to spending transparency in Greece and Slovenia appear to be somewhat driven by factors not related to public pressure for transparency. In Greece the crisis has created a significant boost to centralised fiscal management endorsed. It is somewhat striking that Greece has gone from one of the least financially transparent in Europe to one of the most transparent. In Greece we have seen that technical experts with specific knowledge on the financial reporting standards and data workflows have been able to deliver precise advice that could advance the reporting models.

In Slovenia the [Supervizor site](https://www.kpk-rs.si/en/project-transparency/supervizor-73) seems to have been driven by a combination of a strong independent anti-corruption commission and access to pro-bono development resources to prototype and develop the models.

Any policy commitments can be hampered by poor implementation
One relevant point might be that campaigning as a CSO for spending transparency is challenging as even well intentioned decisions at policy level can be followed up by poor technical implementation.

For example the EU procurement register (TED) has for many years published procurement data with essential data fields such as amounts or contract winner appearing missing. The lack of data quality is likely caused either because data fields are considered non-mandatory or because of other accountability flaws in the data workflow between EU and member states. The lack of understanding of data quality at policy level means that it is challenging for CSOs to drive forward a conversation around practical data quality.

Hasadna is an example of successful advocacy on data quality on Israels budgeting process. The CSO has filed continued inquiries, which has lead to very direct dialogue with the ministry responsible for the budgetary system.

No matter the political declaration spending data will in the end never be better than the technical developers who set up the financial reporting system.

The hole between open data and FOI
The increasing availability of budget, spending and procurement data via public sites has enabled some organisations to work without the need to run regular Freedom of Information requests (FOIs). However the norm is more often that groups needs to work with both means - while some can be retrieved via government sites others data sets must be retrieved as FOIs. While some organisations with both technical and legal expertise such as K-Monitor cover both areas, we find that strengthening FOI skills could help improve their ability to access data through traditional FOI requests.

You are not alone - language barriers challenge the idea of a global community

In several countries we’ve seen that energised CSOs are running impressive projects often with few resources. In countries such as India, Slovenia and Greece we however also see that language barriers can become a factor affecting the ability to share and acquire new strategies. We note that despite having multiple online forums to discuss transparency, conversations tend to be occurring largely without representation of activists from the global south.

While there are no easy fixes to this we consider it important to recognise that the financial transparency community remain largely anglophone in the conversation and that a greater diversity of voices will be needed if we wish to broaden the conversation deeper.

Of such projects, which we consider outside the global network of the civic sector could be Hutspace and India Spend.
Looking ahead

Don’t reinvent the wheel
Many of the budget and spending projects which we feature in this report have developed tailored applications fitting their particular conditions. From the comprehensive budget site of Hasadna to the database of K-Monitor in Hungary http://www.k-monitor.hu/search platforms have been developed to adapt to the data available and the focus of the individual project.

Applying tools according to the needs is important. However at the same time we find important to highlight that mapping of tools and templates already available can help offer. To help CSOs to assess tool and development could help the limited technical resources to be brought to most possible use and limit technical isolation of projects. When designing individually tailored applications CSOs commit themselves to a certain set of developer skills and risk becoming unnecessarily dependent on the tech side of a project.

Teach people
Based on the interview we’ve found that several skills are repeatedly emerging. While the pool of skills is hugely diversity across the community, key parts of the data pipeline from data retrieval to data cleaning are major hurdles, which steal time from activism and other parts of the work.

We could therefore see a strong potential in offering focused trainings around the key needs identified:
webscrabing: when budget and procurement data needs to be peeled of the web scraping in the only option. We see no reason for to wait for governments to publish the data in bulk, so trainings in tools like ScraperWiki could help expand skills and increase data retrieval
liberate and clean PDFs quickly: with new tools available there’s a real potential for upgrading the skills of communities. Both when it comes to web scraping and PDF liberation scaling models should be explored. As the needs for these tools are common and accessible a set up of training of trainers should be explored, in order to build the local pools of skills.
build FOI request skills: Help groups acquire the FOI skills needed for advancing access to spending data, as many countries still apply archaic principles of FOI.
the various other tools in the ecosystem should be shared


Develop strategies for obtaining quick wins on transactional spending transparency
The past three years UK, Brazil, US, Slovenia and Greece has released transactional spending data. Despite those successes it is relevant to ask why release policies on transactional spending data have not spread faster eg. to neighboring countries.

The spending community should be equipped to push for spending data by mapping access, regulation and publication flows across countries.

Language - boost translations
The demand for training materials and knowledge sharing outside the anglophone language community should be addressed. In practise this can be done by providing trainings in first languages across countries where spending transparency is advanced.

Multi-language knowledge sharing should also include boosting translations of key resource materials such as the Spending Data Handbook into multiple languages. As practical factsheets are being drafted on topics such as spending standards, FOI-models, privacy and data analysis these should be translated as well. Distribution across CSO networks should also be increased in order to reach the organisations who might work on spending transparency.
