# Scaling efforts: OpenSpending - from International to Local level spending 

Whether or not it could be classed as directly causation, it is possible that having the possibility of elegant and intuitive visualisations can drive government data release at a local level from the supply side. 

By way of example of this fact, OffenerHaushalt in Germany was launched with a small note on the page, saying “If you are a local government and you are interested in producing your own visualisation site such as this, then please write to us.” To date, the OffenerHaushalt team have received 70-90 requests for similar sites in Germany at different levels of government, often from government officials themselves. 

Being able to cater to these different levels of government and different bodies within government was one of the prime reasons for building OpenSpending: A solution was needed that could produce something like <a href="http://wheredoesmymoneygo.org">Where Does My Money Go?</a> in less than half a day (given good data.), otherwise, it simply would not have been possible to scale down to the local level. 


## Some key local uses of OpenSpending 

Since its launch, OpenSpending has had a continuous flow of requests from stakeholders at local levels. By May 2013 more than 80 cities had been added to OpenSpending from citizens, local political parties and local administration officials. A substantial amount of connections have also been made to local budgeting initiatives using technology to enhance participation. 

It is our impression that local spending has a strong potential for a few reasons:

* Local spending has a clear and direct impact peoples daily life, which seems to invite a wide group of citizens and communities to engage with the process.
* Active citizens tend to know where to access data in their local community more easily than national data. You might even know who to speak to in the local council if the data is not available.
* Local focus helps drive community focus to local institutions that matter financially. 

### Japan

The OpenSpending community in Japan has been working largely with a city-based focus. Yokohama initiated in 2012 a <a href="http://spending.jp/">local spending site</a> using the Daily Bread and budget visualisations. Since 11 additional cities have had their budgets visualised. At Open Data Day February 2013, the group expanded the initiative with another site for the <a href="http://chiba.spending.jp/">city of Chiba</a>, which received a visit as well as positive feedback from the mayor of Chiba.

Is group characterised with a strong representation of both governance experts from academia as well as programmers with the technical skills to implement complex budget sites.  

Results: Since February 2013 the community has grown across Japan and spurred the development of budget visualisations for 12 additional cities. 

Next step and challenges: The community is will now looking to explore more detailed budget data as well as transactional spending data. A plan for including transactional data from two prefectural governments is underway. 

### Other uses of OpenSpending

In addition, we have seen a number of CSOs and citizens make use of OpenSpending to serve specific visualisation needs outside the realm of pure budget and spending transparency.  

* <a href="http://www.fundacjafenomen.pl/">Fundacja Normalne Miasto Fenomen</a>, Poland: Used OpenSpending to visualise data on transportation spending for the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fopenspending.org%2Flodz_2013_transport_budget&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGQheo8Wg1kQ7ztn27o2k7TqcsV8Q">city of  Łódź</a>, in order to advance their environmental agenda. 
	
* Social liberal party (D66) of Rotterdam, The Netherlands: Using budget data from the city of Rotterdam to help inform elected officials and decide on local priorities within the party. The purpose was in the first place to help the party to decide on budget priorities, and secondly to advocate the city it self to adopt the practise of visualising the budget to its citizens in a meaningful way. A similar example was seen with the budget of Uruguay for 2012 from the Uruguayan Office of Planning and Budget. 

* As previously mentioned, the search interface of OpenSpending was used by Privacy International <a href="http://openspending.org/blog/2012/02/24/how-spending-stories-fact-checks-big-brother-the-wiretappers-ball.html">to do research into which companies are selling surveillance equipment had contracts with governments around the world</a>. 

* OpenSpending was used to visualise the <a href="http://openspending.org/blog/2013/04/06/Visualising-Urban-development-data-at-UN-Habitat.html">UN-Habitat data on Urban Development</a>.  

* In collaboration with Publish What You Fund, OpenSpending was used to provide the <a href="http://publishwhatyoufund.org/uganda/#/~/aid-and-domestic-spending-in-uganda-br----usd-">first consolidated view of the budget of Uganda</a> including income from aid flows, which form a substantial part of the revenue flows for Uganda. Even the government of Uganda had previously not had access to this information.
