There are several initiatives which standardize data related to the 
specific types that we are looking at. Here's a brief overview:

* [IATI](http://aidtransparency.net), the International Aid Transparency
  Initiative, is a successful campaign to standardize the form in which
  information about international development projects is reported by 
  donor states, implementing organizations and recipient countries. 
* [XBRL](http://www.xbrl.org/), the eXtensible Business Reporting
  Language, is a data container framework in which specific taxonomies
  can be used to report financial information, in particular related 
  to accounting methods such as US GAAP. The emerging specification for
  a [General Ledger](http://www.xbrl.org/GLTaxonomy) taxonomy can also represent more fine-grained, 
  transactional information, but requires its users to understand a 
  complex format. 
* The UK Treasury has [published guidance documents](http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/psr_transparency_index.htm) with instructions to central government bodies regarding the release of fine-grained expenditure data. The specification gives some guidance on the format of the data 
but has proven to be too imprecise in practice.
