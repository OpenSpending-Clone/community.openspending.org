title: Help to make this standard
---

As we proceed to refine our ideas for an international spending standard, 
we hope to collaborate with a wide range of practicioners, from 
government to civil society, auditors to industry suppliers. 

The idea of a standard format for expenditure data can only work if 
many re-users and data publishers join together to make a specification 
that is easy to implement and useful in practice. 

We're inviting everyone to contribute to this effort: 

* Subscribe to our [mailing list](http://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/openspending) to share your ideas and requests.

* If you're a technical user, create pull requests on the specification at GitHub.
