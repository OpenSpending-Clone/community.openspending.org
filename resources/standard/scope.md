title: Scope of the Proposal

Levels of standardization:

* Document best practices
* Container format spec - ie. CSV vs. Excel vs. XML
* Metadata spec: granularity, geographic and temporal coverage, domain coverage
* Managing types of taxonomies (e.g. economic, functional, also: geographic, procedural) and expressing their presence via metadata.
* Align individual taxonomies via mapping mechanisms (e.g. the current work on establishing a COFOG spine for mapping IATI data releases)
