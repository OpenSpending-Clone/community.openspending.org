<h3>What is transactional spending data?</h3>

Spending data in this document refers to transactional information as evidence of individual (or lightly aggregated) payments of government to a supplier or other recipient. This is different 
it from budgetary information, in which high-level, aggregate figures describe projected or executed
spending allocated under programmes or objectives.

<h3>What aspects of the data will be covered by the standard?</h3>

Core specification:

* Container format 



Levels of standardization:

* Document best practices
* Container format spec - ie. CSV vs. Excel vs. XML
* Metadata spec: granularity, geographic and temporal coverage, domain coverage
* Managing types of taxonomies (e.g. economic, functional, also: geographic, procedural) and expressing their presence via metadata.
* Align individual taxonomies via mapping mechanisms (e.g. the current work on establishing a COFOG spine for mapping IATI data releases)

<h3>Does the standard cover legal aspects?</h3>

The standard does not contain a legal component, but governments and organisations that release data in the specified format must also supply a license which is in accordance with the [open definition](http://opendefinition.org/) and thus enables free and non-discriminatory re-use of the information.
