Next month OpenSpending will be at the annual DataHarvest when investigative journalists and civic coders dig into data projects from across Europe. The DataHarvest takes it name from the annual release of payments to farmers under the Common Agricultural Policy, which is crunched by the folks at [Farmsubsidy](www.farmsubsidy.org).

At OpenSpending we wanted to follow up on the work on EU procurements, which we believe could be a great source to share with journalists. Opented.org did some of the ground work [scraping](http://opented.org/code-repositories/) and parsing of the [TED data](http://opented.org/getthedata/). 

We're therefore excited to invite for a Hack Day on procurement data on May 2 thanks to the [Mozilla OpenNews programme](http://www.mozillaopennews.org/). 

We hope that you'll [join us](http://procurement-hack.eventbrite.com/#) in person or remotely. 

### Why open up procurements?
Procurement data tended, for good reasons, to enjoy much less attention from journalists than for instance spending data. A major reason is the fact that contract information tend to be more about text than spreadsheets, but also because access to aggregate data has been limited. However with access to more than 100,000 public sector contracts annually from the [European procurement register](https://ted.europa.eu) originating from tiny municipalities to large government agencies, there are good reasons to explore if contracts can help fill out the blanks. What is needed is good data feeds, which can provide journalists with contract data beyond the single search options offered at TED. So how does contract data supplement other data sources?

####When spending data is unavailable 
Spending data is useful as it provide a clear paper trail of actual individual payments over time, unlike contract information, which often include an indication by the tme of contract award. However today, most European governments have yet to publish transactional spending data as it for instance practised in the [UK](http://openspending.org/ukgov-25k-spending) and [Slovenia](https://www.kpk-rs.si/en/faq/supervizor). When looking at pubic agencies outside government such as regions or municipalities, where a sizeable share of government spending is executed getting transactional spending data there might be an even further way to go. , publishing transactional spending  outside the UK we should not even get staretd on the lack of spending data at regional and municipal level. Therefore procurement data on contracts awarded from any public agency above the EU threshold at EUR 200,000, is often the only resort for a paper trail documenting public spending on particular contractors.       

####Getting a sneak peak into publicly owned companies 
The public most often do not hold gain access to information on spending from publicly owned companies such as utilities operators and transportation. It is however an often overlooked fact that EU procurement rules apply to such companies. Therefore the public can access more than 500 contracts awarded by Vattenfall in all the countries where they operate, such as [this contract awarded from their Berlin based company](http://ted.europa.eu/udl?uri=TED:NOTICE:12176-2013:TEXT:EN:HTML&src=0), due to the fact that it is majority owned by the Swedish state. 

####Contracts - source for single stories
Journalists can use contract data to tell the stories on questionable [recipients of contracts](http://euobserver.com/institutional/116152) or [no-bid contracts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-bid_contract), when authorities "forgets" to announce a formal tender process. An open and searchable database of contracts would innevetable improve the possibilities for covering such procurement processes more systematic. Would it be possible to create an alert, which notified journalists whenever a payment above EUR 200,000 was done to a supplier in the spending data, whithout appearing in the register for official contract winners?  

###Why we're still short of good data feed for EU procurements 
When journalists haven't spend more time extractng data from TED until now there are however a few reasons. 
If spending data is available, it will tend to be more accurate as it depicts the final amount of each payment - ie. all purchases at [IBM for the UK Department of Transportation](http://openspending.org/ukgov-25k-spending/from/driver-and-vehicle-licensing-agency/entries#from:driver-and-vehicle-licensing-agency/to:ibm-united-kingdom-limited). For contracts the indicated amount will often merly include a total sum for the entirety of the contract. It is also the case that contracts tend to contain lots of messy text data, where the service or work is described in simplified terms.

Transparency organisations and international institutions have however also begun looking at contract data, though until now mostly outside the EU. The last year has seen lots of new initiatives on procurement including #opencontracting from WBI and Sunight's [Procurement Initiative](http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2013/03/11/announcing-a-new-procurement-initiative/). A few weeks back the folks at WBI helped lay out some ground work for [a draft for a data standard](https://github.com/birdsarah/oc-datamerge-spike/tree/master/draft-standard) based on procurement data from the UK, US, Columbia, the Phillipines and the World Bank. For EU procurement data, I've helped write up a similar suggested draft at [OpenTed](http://opented.org/getthedata/data-standards-in-procurement/). 
Tim Davies recently wrote up this account on the work to sort out a  [draft of a contracting data standard](http://www.timdavies.org.uk/2013/04/04/developing-data-standards-for-open-contracting/).   

We hope to see you at the Procurement Hack Day in Brussels on May 2
