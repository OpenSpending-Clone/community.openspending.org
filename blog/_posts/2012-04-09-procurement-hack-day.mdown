Next month OpenSpending will be at the annual DataHarvest when investigative journalists and civic hackers dig deep into data projects from across Europe. The DataHarvest takes it name from the annual release of farm subsidy data, which is again this year crunched by Farmsubsidy.org.

At OpenSpending we've got a project on EU procurements, which would be great to share with journalists. Opented.org did some of the ground work [scraping](http://opented.org/code-repositories/) and parsing of the [TED data](http://opented.org/getthedata/). 

We're therefore pretty excited to announce that OpenSpending will invite for a Hack Day on procurement data on May 2 thanks to the support of @pudo and [Mozilla OpenNews](http://www.mozillaopennews.org/). 

We hope that you'll [join us](http://procurement-hack.eventbrite.com/#) in person or remotely. 

### Why open up procurements?
Procurement data has for good reasons enjoyed less attention from journalists than for instance spending data. A major reason for this is the that we have yet to develop [good data feeds](http://pudo.org/blog/2013/04/08/inklink-eu-through-data.html) for the more than 100,000 contracts, which are published annually by the [European procurement register](https://ted.europa.eu). There are however many reasons to take a dive into contracts as they can help fill out the blanks. 

####When spending data is unavailable 
Most European governments have yet to publish transactional spending data as for instance done in the [UK](http://openspending.org/ukgov-25k-spending) and [Slovenia](https://www.kpk-rs.si/en/faq/supervizor). And outside the UK we should not even get staretd on the lack of spending data at regional and municipal level. Therefore procurement data on contracts awarded from any public above the EU threshold at approx. EUR 200,000, is often the only resort for a paper trail documenting public spending on particular contractors.       

####A back door into publicly owned companies 
We've not managed yet to gain access to publicly owned companies such as utilities and transportation. However with EU procurement rules, we can for instance search among the more than 500 contracts awarded by Vattenfall across Europe, such as [this contract in Berlin](http://ted.europa.eu/udl?uri=TED:NOTICE:12176-2013:TEXT:EN:HTML&src=0), due to the fact that it is majority owned by the Swedish state. 

####Contracts - source for single stories
Journalists can use contract data to tell the stories on questionable [recipients of contracts](http://euobserver.com/institutional/116152) or [no-bid contracts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-bid_contract), when authorities "forgets" to announce a formal tender process. An open and searchable database of contracts would innevetable improve the possibilities for covering such procurement processes more systematic. Would it be possible to create an alert, which notified journalists whenever a payment above EUR 200,000 was done to a supplier in the spending data, whithout appearing in the register for official contract winners?  

###Why we're still short of good data feed for EU procurements 
When journalists haven't spend more time extractng data from TED until now there are however a few reasons. 
If spending data is available, it will tend to be more accurate as it depicts the final amount of each payment - ie. all purchases at [IBM for the UK Department of Transportation](http://openspending.org/ukgov-25k-spending/from/driver-and-vehicle-licensing-agency/entries#from:driver-and-vehicle-licensing-agency/to:ibm-united-kingdom-limited). For contracts the indicated amount will often merly include a total sum for the entirety of the contract. It is also the case that contracts tend to contain lots of messy text data, where the service or work is described in simplified terms.

Transparency organisations and international institutions have however also begun looking at contract data, though until now mostly outside the EU. The last year has seen lots of new initiatives on procurement including #opencontracting from WBI and Sunight's [Procurement Initiative](http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2013/03/11/announcing-a-new-procurement-initiative/). A few weeks back the folks at WBI helped lay out some ground work for [a draft for a data standard](https://github.com/birdsarah/oc-datamerge-spike/tree/master/draft-standard) based on procurement data from the UK, US, Columbia, the Phillipines and the World Bank. For EU procurement data, I've helped write up a similar suggested draft at [OpenTed](http://opented.org/getthedata/data-standards-in-procurement/). 
Tim Davies recently wrote up this account on the work to sort out a  [draft of a contracting data standard](http://www.timdavies.org.uk/2013/04/04/developing-data-standards-for-open-contracting/).   

We hope to see you at the Procurement Hack Day in Brussels on May 2
