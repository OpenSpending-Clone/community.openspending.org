On 2 May 18 civic coders and journalists from across Europe from Norway to Slovenia met up in Brussels for a Hack Day supported by [Knight Mozilla Open News](www.mozillaopennews.org/) to dig into the EU procurement register, [Tender Electronic Daily](ted.europa.eu). Here are the highlights from the event and what we've been up to since. 

### Scraping and parsing of TED into OpenTED 
Several people got together to build and improve the parsing of data already scraped. You can find the latest updates and find out how you can help [here](https://github.com/opented/opented). 

###Showcases - Slovenian and Greek procurement cases

### User stories - ideas for data journalism on procurement data
During the Hack Day a good handful of datajournalists gathered to line up more than 20 questions on procurements, which should be investigated by journalists such as: 

####Key questions to ask
- Where in the EU are highways most expensive to build?
- What are the best ways to expose cartel formations
- What companies are running food services at public school (and what's on the menu)?
- Who is the biggest weapons salesman in the EU?
- Who are the biggest public transport providers - Arriva vs. Connexion?
- What's the relationship between procurement process (time) and what companies gets the contract?
- How many contracts go outside the EU?
- Do the governments purchase from big or small suppliers?
- How can we predict when a project will go over budget?
- What sector is the least competitive (CPV-code vs. average bid)? 
- Are there companies within certain sectors that get a suspicous large amount of contracts?

####Using other data with procurement data from TED
- Reconcile with company data from Opencorporates
- Match contracts to actual spending data eg. [UK government spending](http://openspending.org/ukgov-25k-spending)
- Ask Freedom of Information requests to the procuring authority for entire contract (see examples of such successful FOI requests [here](http://www.asktheeu.org/en/request/292/response/805/attach/2/Signed%20Framework%20Agreement%20with%20Eurocontrol.PDF.pdf) and [here](http://www.asktheeu.org/en/request/293/response/909/attach/3/answer%20del%20BD%20GESTDEM%202012%205786.pdf)
- Get to understand what the contracts are actually about with the [official taxonomy of the CPV-code](http://simap.europa.eu/codes-and-nomenclatures/codes-cpv/codes-cpv_en.htm)

### A first look at the TED data
Two weeks after the Hack Day the [full TED data set](http://opented.pudo.org) is now available, thanks to the hack team and in particular [Friedrich Lindenberg](twitter.com/pudo).

We hope that many of you will dig right in and examine the either procurements across EU or in your own country. If you would like to know more about the format, we've uploaded the [data for Czech Republic (2013)](https://docs.google.com/a/okfn.org/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AvdkMlz2NopEdEtxU3dDYktRT3ltbTdadnZBcmdaVVE#gid=0) as a sample. 

####Reviewing the data quality
At a community call on May 15, it was agreed to do a thorough quality review of the data available in TED. 
You can join us testing the data [here](https://docs.google.com/a/okfn.org/document/d/16tXDgtMQVIX5TnzWPPZScRZEd0FkW14Zcc_lche5T_w/edit#) for the following:
The first look at the TED data has indicated that the inaccuracy is a major challenge. Many important fields in the dataset such as "contract amount" or "number of bids" for the contract are simply non-mandatory, which cause them often to be left blank. In other cases amounts are assigned in the wrong format using commas and decimals interchangeably. With the review we will get some numbers on the overall data quality, which we'll share as soon as they are ready. Let us know if you want to get involved cleaning or analysing the data.
