Over the past few months, the team at Open Spending has been working hard to deliver a brand new version of Open Spending and we’re now excited to announce the Alpha version release. The new version is targeted to all users who have an interest in advancing the openess of budget and spending data. 

Whether you are a non-technical person, or a data professional, whether you're journalist or an administrator, Open Spending Next is getting ready for your use.

You can start publishing your first OpenSpending data directly from the import tool. You can then use **Open Spending Next** to quickly create and customize beautiful visualisations based on your data, analyse and compare different datasets on the fly:

1. Upload your budget CSV file
2. Map your budget file with the Fiscal Data Package (Necessary data: Amount  (numeric format, no space, no commas) + Date/Time (ISO format)
3. Visualise your budget

Also, you'll be able to create a budget data collection, search other fiscal datasets, create filters and maps ! 

## Contributing
At Open Knowledge, we have a tradition of including the public in our projects as part of the process. We would want to hear from you, know your experience, help and support your projects, discuss your suggestions and implement your ideas, so we contribute to greater fiscal transparency. 

We're counting on your support, since input from a wide range of users and organizations is going to be necessary to meet users’ needs and make the Fiscal Data Package become a true standard. It's time for yet another open consultation session and we’re excited about it!

###How can you contribute?

There are numerous ways to leave feedback on the alpha version:

1. Have you tried uploading a dataset and encountered errors? Found a bug? Report them [here on our Github repo](https://github.com/openspending/openspending/issues), make sure you include a screenshot, and describe with as much details as possible (attach source file or provide link of the data set that you’re testing)
2. Any ideas for improvement? Any important feature we’ve missed? [Let us know!](https://github.com/openspending/openspending/issues)
3. Organise an OpenSpending event! Bring people around the table, discuss how Fiscal Transparency can improve your work and the community you are a part of. Let us know how we can help and support you by leaving a request on the [dedicated forum](https://discuss.okfn.org/c/openspending).

During the transition process, we plan to convert all previous uploaded datasets to the new model and host them in the new database. We’d like to remind you that during this process, the current OpenSpending platform will be in a read-only mode in order to preserve and secure the existing datasets while we're doing significant changes on the core data base.
