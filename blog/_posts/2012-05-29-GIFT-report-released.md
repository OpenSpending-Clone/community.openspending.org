In early March, we embarked on a project to map out projects which use [technology to further the aims of fiscal transparency, accountability and participation](http://openspending.org/blog/2012/03/12/technology-for-fiscal-transparency-where-next.html). Today, we are happy to announce the official release of the resulting report, Technology for Transparent and Accountable Public Finance. Preliminary findings were presented at last month's [GIFT](http://fiscaltransparency.net/) meeting in Brasilia. Since then, we've been building on the comments, follow-up questions and feedback from the session. 

We have tried to highlight specific roles which GIFT could play in promoting the good practice requirements of the report. The slides from the session can be found below:

## More about the project

Looking at government revenue, expenditure and off-budget information - we have attempted to identify projects from both governments and civil society which use innovative approaches to: 

* Publish more or better data related to fiscal processes (aid, revenues, budgets, audits, etc. -- see below),
* Help understand this data through the creation of better visualisation and data analysis tools,
* Educate citizens about fiscal processes, and assist civil society organisations promoting accountable governance,
* Facilitate direct participation in fiscal matters through participatory budgeting, citizen auditing and the like,
* Provide policymakers with complete and reliable data relevant to their work, enabling them to make better decisions.

We focussed in particular on the question: 'Who are the users?'. We examined their motivations for getting involved, the scalability and applicability of given solutions to other contexts. The report also aims to highlight gaps that prevent users from taking up these tools.

## Report now available online

Today, the first edition of the report is being made available on [OpenSpending.org](http://openspending.org/resources/gift/index.html). It is also available for download as a PDF. Accompanying the report is a [project database](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AvoV_cBqwo28dDBHNUJaWUFLQS1rNDY3YWFBcU5VQ0E&pli=1#gid=0) which contains many more projects that publish, analyse and demystify fiscal data. 

The section on participatory budgeting deserves special mention. We discovered so many projects that they merited their own listing, which can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AvoV_cBqwo28dE9fZy02NEt2UGxPTnRQMTEzaUhTOGc#gid=4). As we go through, we are building up a catalog of government finance portals in [the 'finance' group of datacatalogs.org](http://datacatalogs.org/group/finance). There's still a lot of work to be done there, but the group already contains the portals mentioned in the report. 

As our work continues, we'd love to maintain these connections and hear updates from the projects and learn about new projects. If you have come across an interesting project and think we should feature it, [please let us know](mailto:gift-report@okfn.org)! 

## A Couple of highlights - excerpts from the report

> * "Lack of information sharing affects civil servants and policy-makers -- not just those outside of government. This was highlighted in the OpenDataBC case study, where approximately one third of traffic to the citizen-facing data portal came from IP addresses within government"

> * “Data is not always actionable simply because it is available.”

> * "Gaps: A standard for transaction level spending data?"

> * "Civil society is often cited as the target users for transparency portals, as was the case for the [Sierra Leone Mining Repository](http://sierraleone.revenuesystems.org/login/auth). However, in reality, 65 % of the users of this platform are investors, donors and other governments, who have knowledge of complex legal terminology and sector-specifics."

> * "Technology is not a fix-all. If a tool is to be successful, it will most likely target a specific aspect of the Participatory Budgeting-cycle. A strategy can target a particular part of the Participatory Budgeting process rather than being a super-app that will work at every stage."

> * "SMS technology has the possibility of reaching out to rural areas with limited internet access, as even those without internet connections often have mobile phones - experiments are currently underway into using mobiles as tools in social auditing."

## Get involved in the next edition

This release is version one, and we hope that the research will be ongoing as the OpenSpending community grows and the tools and network develop. As this happens, we'd really love your input. Some suggestions: 

1. Feedback - let us know what you thought of the report and suggest improvements, particularly feedback for GIFT, what role would you like to see them play in this important field? 
2. Keep your eyes peeled for interesting projects. We're hoping to feature information about new projects in the blog, so drop a line to the [mailing list](http://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/openspending) if you know of any we should feature. 
3. Help us build up the [finance group on datacatalogs.org](http://datacatalogs.org/group/finance) and review the sites for their usefulness. Ever tried to get fiscal information out of a portal? Did you get what you were after? And importantly, could you use it once you had it? Let us know [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dGNXNVFXdDlPNlRDaXB2bXc0aGR5UVE6MQ#gid=0).

Follow up posts on the findings in detail coming soon!
