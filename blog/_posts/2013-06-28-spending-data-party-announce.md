We're thrilled to 

up the spending in your city during our spending data party in July. In collaboration with Hasadna (israel), OKF Japan, OpenBudgetOakland and hopefully many more we're looking to open up city spending near you. 

You can sign up for the [Spending Data Party here](https://docs.google.com/a/okfn.org/forms/d/1uHNAh9cfP_F5nudGfhV8t0XnNPmFL7cXhkuqWHAMaR4/viewform).

####Do you live in a city?
More than half of us [live in cities](http://www.unfpa.org/pds/urbanization.htm). Whether your your local bus service is paid by your city, council or [Município](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipalities_of_Brazil) chances are that the service is operated locally and that you know who would have the information. So whereever you live there is a local that can be opened budget. With the City Spending Data Party we want to open budget and spending data from cities to help us all get a sense of where the money is being spend.

What do we want to help create?<br>
- How much does my city spend on education?

- Do other people care about city spending as well. OpenBudgetOakland published a budget with fields where you can comment. 

- What businesses operate in my street and do they pay corporate tax? 

#### Who should join?
