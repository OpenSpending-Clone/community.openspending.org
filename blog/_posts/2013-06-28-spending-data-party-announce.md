More than half of us [live in a city](http://www.unfpa.org/pds/urbanization.htm). From schools to fire brigades cities are responsible for some of the most important services we can think of when it comes to government. So whether the nearby school is paid by your city, council or [Município](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipalities_of_Brazil) chances are that the service is operated locally and that you know who would have the information. So whereever you live there is a local that can be opened budget. With the City Spending Data Party we want to open budget and spending data from cities to help us all get a sense of where the money is being spent.

We're thrilled to announce that the OpenSpending community is coming together to organise a global **City Spending Party** in cities across the world from **July 19th to 21st**. The event is becoming reality thanks to the engagement from a great area of groups including [Hasadna](http://www.hasadna.org.il/en/) (israel), [OpenBudgetOakland](http://openbudgetoakland.org/), [OpenKratio](openkratio.org/), [OKF Japan](http://spending.jp/) and [OKF Nepal](https://twitter.com/okfn_np). We're hoping that many more of you will join to open up the budget and spending of your city. 

You can sign up for the [Spending Data Party here](https://docs.google.com/a/okfn.org/forms/d/1uHNAh9cfP_F5nudGfhV8t0XnNPmFL7cXhkuqWHAMaR4/viewform).

####Explore your city - what to look for<br>
<il>- Do you know how much you city actually spends on education compared to police enforcement?</il>

<il>- How can you get people involved in the budget of your city?
[OpenBudgetOakland](http://openbudgetoakland.org/mayor_13-15_proposed.html) created a site where citizens could comment on the budget proposal throughout the entire decision process. 

<il>- Which companies works for your city and do they actually do a good job?</il>
Some cities such as [London](http://openspending.org/gb-local-gla) and [Washington DC](http://openspending.org/dc-vendors-contractors) transactional spending allow you to see what companies clean up the garbage and repair the roads. Let's make many more cities open up their spending data!
