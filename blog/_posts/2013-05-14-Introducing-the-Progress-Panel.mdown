For the past months we've seen an increase in contributions of data to OpenSpeding from across the community. The community now use OpenSending to visualise budget data from more than [80 cities](http://apps.openspending.org/maps/) and most recently [universities](http://openspending.org/ugr-spending) have also found their way onto OpenSpending.

While we're thrilled by the uptake in use of openspending for visualising budgets, we've however also noticed that transactional spending data are added to the platform less often than we'd hope for. We're well aware that transactional datasets can be difficult to both get a hold of and work with:
- governments tend not to release them easily 
- the data tend to be of a size that makes cleaning in Excel difficult
- loading of data can be complicated if data contains lots of colums

That's why we're launching a new feature today, which we hope will enable users better to collaborate around adding datasets to OpenSpending.

### Enter the Progress Panel
The [Data Progress panel](http://progress.openspending.org/) is now live. We'd love if you'd have a look and let us know what you think! 

With the Progress Panel we wish to make it easy to show what datasets people are working on and what help is needed. 

### What can you do there?
- Request a dataset you'd like to see on OpenSpending. 
- Claim a dataset you'd like to clean and upload to OpenSpending - and ask the list for help if needed
- Check what datasets other people are working on - and offer your help if you can

In other words, we hope that the Progress Panel can help assist in a few cases, for instance:
- "I'm working on a dataset, but got stuck cleaning the spreadsheet - who can help?"
- "I've found this excellent dataset on Italian structural Fund payments. I would like to add it to OS, but need help translating the columns before uploading."
- "I wonder if someone is already working to add the EU budget to OpenSpending?"

At this early stage we're really interested to hear feedback from you, so let us know how we can make the panel useful for tracking progress of datasets. Share your thoughts on our [mailing list](http://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/openspending).
