Earlier this January I attended a conference in Morocco at the
University of Mundiapolis in Casablanca, to present OpenSpending; the
conference attracted a broad range of interests: civil society
organisations, journalists, private companies, academics and students,
the World Bank, and a senior representative of the Ministry of
Finance.

It was the experience of MySociety that their parliamentary monitoring
tools were never accused of being partisan. It's important to keep
out of conventional politics: we're here to say "if you have transparency,
this is what you get" not "you should have transparency" or "you should spend
more money on this and less on that". The bulk of my presentation was on
four or five country studies, demonstrating the diversity of the places
which can use OpenSpending.

Transparency International Morocco had taken the OpenSpending software
and got it working themselves, and encountered some problems. I was
able to speak at length to their staff to discuss the issues they were
having and what could done about them. What they wanted was:

0) French and Arabic language support; (Arabic is a right-to-left
language like Hebrew, so this is harder). When Samuel Lee demonstrated
his mobile app in Arabic, there was a marked uptick in audience attention.

1) the ability to link deeply into the visualisations from
department-specific discussion pages hosted in some external
pre-existing system (I think this is Facebook)

2) a good list of the best quality country-level datasets such that
fiscal transparency is not seen to be preponderantly a Western or
developed world phenomenon (we discuseed this; my presentation at the
conference concentrated on this)

3) some sort of case studies on the process of getting governments to open up
spending information; how this interacts if at all with the freedom of
information laws

4) some assistance with getting the WDMMG assembly kit working for them

Fundamentally, they're in the business of demonstrating what can usefully
be done with more detailed spending data; OpenSpending is a key tool
in a much larger process.
