This is a post by [Martin Keegan](http://mk.ucant.org/).

Earlier this January I attended a conference in Morocco at the
University of Mundiapolis in Casablanca, to present OpenSpending; the
conference attracted a broad range of interests: civil society
organisations, journalists, private companies, academics and students,
the World Bank, and a senior representative of the Ministry of
Finance.

There was some press coverage from
[L'economiste](http://www.leconomiste.com/article/902383-la-transparence-budg-taire-fait-d-bat)
and [La Nouvelle
Tribune](http://www.lnt.ma/economie/la-transparence-budgetaire-au-centre-dune-rencontre-debat-63825.html)

It was the experience of MySociety that their parliamentary monitoring
tools were never accused of being partisan. It's important to keep
out of conventional politics: we're here to say "if you have transparency,
this is what you get" not "you should have transparency" or "you should spend
more money on this and less on that". The bulk of my presentation was on
four or five country studies, demonstrating the diversity of the places
which can use OpenSpending.

What maybe was not clear to the audience (and indeed, the press
coverage reflected this) was how OpenSpending and similar tools fit
into the landscape.  I was directly asked "is the Government of
Morocco going to use OpenSpending?", and very firmly responded that
this was a question for the Government (after all, a representative of
the government was sat only a few paces away).  The boundary between
government and private sector (both commercial and civil society) is
always evolving and sometimes contested, and it may be locate differently
in different societies. OpenSpending enables actors of all types (government,
private commercial, private non-profit and individuals) to participate
in discussions of spending, and by changing the costs can help enable
some actors to participate where previously this was infeasible.



what role is this tool playing? process



The details of any national budget are a always a matter of healthy
political controversy, and this is [especially true of
Morocco](http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/11/18/us-morocco-protest-idUSBRE8AH0LX20121118). 

The Moroccan constitution contains an as yet unimplemented undertaking
to establish a Freedom of Information law; this would enable civil society
to obtain some information about expenditure. However, FOI laws tend not
to allow the requester to specify the format of the material published,
or that it be published as open data. Where governments publish fiscal
information AND comply with an FOI law, it can be a [somewhat confrontational
move](http://constitution-unit.com/2011/05/24/we-can-work-it-out-eric-pickles-vs-nottingham-city-council/) to use the FOI laws to compel publication of fiscal data

Transparency International Morocco had taken the OpenSpending software
and [got it working themselves](http://floussna.ma/), but did
encounter some problems. I was able to speak at length to their staff
to discuss the issues they were having and what could done about
them. They were using OpenSpending as part of their efforts to increase
fiscal literacy in their country, and they wanted to be able to point
news articles and discussion forums at it. These already existed, and so
OpenSpending had to find its place within a larger ecosystem.

Specifically, what was needed was as follows:

0) French and Arabic language support; Morocco uses several languages for
different purposes: French is used in commerce and the private sector and
academia (all the advertising in Casablanca was in French); Arabic is
used by government and spoken as the home language by the majority of
the population; Berber languages such as Tamazight are used by a substantial
minority and have recently received official status, and Spanish and English
are widely known. 

To be useful, OpenSpending needs to be available in French at the very
least. This is just a matter of translation, and our efforts are
apparently about 20% complete. Arabic on the other hand is one of the
few living languages which is written right-to-left language (like
Hebrew, Yiddish and Tamazight), so this presents some web design
challenges.

It is already possible to submit datasets to OpenSpending in other
languages (though not really, as I understand it, to have a dataset
with multiple translations, without going to some duplication of effort),
but the software interface must be translated separately.

When Samuel Lee demonstrated his World Bank mobile app in Arabic at
the conference, there was a marked uptick in audience attention;
ultimately OpenSpending is going to need an Arabic translation; it's
an official language in about twenty countries, many of which don't
use multiple languages Moroccan-style.


1) In Morocco, there is discussion of particular budget items in Facebook
forums and similar sites; it is either impossible or non-obvious how to
link into a particular view of a visualisation in OpenSpending from one
of these external systems, as opposed to linking to the dataset itself;
this is also useful for news sites that don't want to embed the visualisations.

2) a good list of the best quality country-level datasets such that
fiscal transparency is not seen to be preponderantly a Western or
developed world phenomenon (we discuseed this; my presentation at the
conference concentrated on this)

3) some sort of case studies on the process of getting governments to open up
spending information; how this interacts if at all with the freedom of
information laws

4) some assistance with getting the WDMMG assembly kit working for them

Fundamentally, they're in the business of demonstrating what can usefully
be done with more detailed spending data; OpenSpending is a key tool
in a much larger process.

The Moroccans placed a particular emphasis on what they termed
"[vulgarisation](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulgarisation)", by which
is meant the business of describing and explaining information intellgible
to experts such that the general public can understand it as well (the word
lacks the pejorative connotations it possesses in English). What this really
means is that in French the motivation of OpenSpending is expressible in
a *single word*.
