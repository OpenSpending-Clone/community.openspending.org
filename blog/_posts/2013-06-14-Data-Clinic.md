Earlier this month we organised the first OpenSpending Data Clinic, with the purpose of offering basic advice on how you can work with your budget or spending data. 
At the first Data CLinic we offered feedback on how to format the Canadian budget and how to convert PDFs from the budget of Barcelona.
<br>
The next Data Clinic will be on Wednesday 19 June at 19:00 CET / 18:00 GMT / 13:00 EDT - [your time zone](http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=OpenSpending+Data+Clinic&iso=20130619T13&p1=263&ah=1) via Google Hangout and IRC channel #openspending.
<br>
Bring your spending data and we'll help you out:<br>
- How to format the data the right way?<br> 
- How to visualise it?<br>
- How convert spending data locked in PDFs?<br>
