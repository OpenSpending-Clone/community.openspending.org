In January I attended a conference in Morocco at the
[University of Mundiapolis in Casablanca](http://mundiapolis.ma/), to present OpenSpending. The
conference attracted a broad range of interests: civil society
organisations, journalists, private companies, academics and students,
the World Bank, and the director general of Morocco's Ministry of
Finance. My presentation ([notes here](http://mk.ucant.org/media/openspending-francais/)) showcased the use of OpenSpending in a variety of countries, by
state, civil and commercial actors.


The local press coverage from the conference reaffirmed the perception
that financial transparency is rising on the agenda in Morocco (in
French

and

Discussions at the conference ranged across the transparency field from concerns about being percieved as partisan 
MySociety, another transparency organisation, which attended the conference noted that their parliamentary monitoring
tools were never accused of being partisan. It's important to keep
out of conventional politics: we're here to say "if you have transparency,
this is what you get" not "you should have transparency" or "you should spend
more money on this and less on that". The bulk of my presentation was on
four or five country studies, demonstrating the diversity of the places
which can use OpenSpending.

It was clear from the conference that both the public, media and government are still trying to make sense how OpenSpending and similar tools fit into the wider landscape. 
I was directly asked by participants: "Is the Government of Morocco going to use OpenSpending?", and very firmly responded that
this was a question for the Government (after all, a representative of
the government was sat only a few paces away). The boundary between
government and private sector (both commercial and civil society) is
always evolving and sometimes contested. Often these boundaries vary
in different societies. At OpenSpending we try to enable actors of all types (government,
private commercial, private non-profit and individuals) to participate
in discussions of spending. By making spending data available to the public without costs can help enable
the public to participate in discussions about how the government spend its money, where this were previously infeasible.


The details of any national budget are a always a matter of healthy
political controversy, and this is [especially true of
Morocco](http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/11/18/us-morocco-protest-idUSBRE8AH0LX20121118). The Moroccan constitution contains an as yet unimplemented undertaking
to establish a Freedom of Information law. It still remains to be seen to what extent this will enable civil society in the future
to obtain more information about expenditures in the Moroccan national budget. In practise Freedom of Information laws will likely not do it alone. They tend often to allow the requester to specify the format of the material published,
or that it be published as open data. Where governments publish fiscal
information AND comply with an FOI law, it can be a [somewhat confrontational
move](http://constitution-unit.com/2011/05/24/we-can-work-it-out-eric-pickles-vs-nottingham-city-council/) to use the FOI laws to compel publication of fiscal data

It was exciting to see that Transparency International Morocco have used the OpenSpending software
for [a site on the Moroccan budget](http://floussna.ma/). They however encountered some challenges with the implementation, which the OpenSpending community will work with them
to help resolve or mitigate these such as language. 

[Samuel Lee from the World Bank demonstrated their new mobile app](http://openspending.org/blog/2013/01/29/worldbank-guest-post.html) and its Arabic language features, which was very well receieved from the participants. 
Ultimately it would be great if OpenSpending could have an Arabic translation; it's
an official language in about twenty countries, many of which don't
use multiple languages as in Morocco. The public role
of OpenSpending to explain budgetary data depends on its ability to be read in the
languages people use. We're therefore pushing for the localization of OpenSpending into
French as well as another 15 languages. You can check our progress and help contribute at our site on the
[translation platform Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/openspending/).


Several participants at the conference placed a particular emphasis on what was termed
"[vulgarisation](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulgarisation)", by which
is meant the business of describing and explaining information intellgible
to experts such that the general public can understand it as well (the word
lacks the pejorative connotations it possesses in English). What this really
means is that in French the motivation of OpenSpending is expressible in
a *single word*. We look forward to follow the developments on budget transparency in Morocco. The broad participation at this conference served to show that the interest will remain strong.
