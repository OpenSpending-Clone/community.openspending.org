Last week leaders from the European Union agreed, after months of haggling, on the EU budget for 2014 to 2020 - also known as the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF). The (â‚¬960bn budget)[http://openspending.org/eu-budget-mff/entries], also available in the [original 48 page PDF-document](http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/en/ec/135344.pdf) is currently awaiting the final approval from the European Parliament. 

Despite accounting for a merely 1.23 percent of EU's GNI, the EU budget should be a big deal for every citizen with a spending nerd hidden inside. Whether you think of (investments in broad band)[http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2013/feb/11/broadband-budget-cut-rural-connection-billion-euro] or the worlds largest (farm subsidy programme)[http://farmsubsidy.org/] the EU budget reflects the priorities of the member states. 

At OpenSpending we want to invite journalists and the public to share experiences about how to access and analyse the spending data behind the budget. Join us <strong>Monday 18 February at 19:00 CET / 18:00 GMT</strong> for a Google Hangout. 

(Ronny Patz)[http://twitter.com/ronpatz] from (Transparency International, Brussels)[http://www.transparencyinternational.eu/] will join us to talk about transparency in EU spending. 

We will discuss some of the questions needed in order to get working on EU spending: 
- Where do I find EU spending data? 
If you have decided to investigate EU spending, one of the first steps will be to find where the spending data is published. We will talk about how to find spending data published both at (EU-level)[http://ec.europa.eu/beneficiaries/fts/index_en.htm] and at (national level)[http://eustructuralfunds.gov.ie/]. Our (map of EU spending)[http://openspending.org/resources/eu/index.html]. 

- What's new in the 2014-2020 budget?
What will the consequenses be to individual prorgammes such as (research)[http://bulletin.sciencebusiness.net/news/76035/Figures-emerge-on-size-of-Horizon-2020-%E2%80%93-and-now-EU-budget-set-to-become-a-political-football].
How do I find out, if the distruibution of structural funds between regions will change with the new budget? 

If the questions above have peeked your interest join us at the Google Hangout. And consider to have a look at some of the (EU spending data)[http://openspending.org/eu-commission-fts] we're already featuring or our (notes on EU spending data)[http://openspending.org/resources/eu/notes.html].
