Last week leaders from the European Union agreed, after months of haggling, on the EU budget for 2014 to 2020 - also known as the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF). The [â‚¬960bn budget](http://openspending.org/eu-budget-mff/entries), also available in the [original 48 page PDF-document](http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/en/ec/135344.pdf). Despite accounting for a merely [1.08 % of EU's GNI](http://europa.eu/newsroom/highlights/multiannual-financial-framework-2014-2020/index_en.htm), the EU budget could be considered a big deal for every citizen or journalist with a spending nerd hidden inside. Whether you think of [investments in broad band](http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2013/feb/11/broadband-budget-cut-rural-connection-billion-euro) or the worlds largest [farm subsidy programme](http://farmsubsidy.org/) the EU budget reflects priorities of the member states, which should be covered. 

At OpenSpending we want to invite journalists and the OpenSpending community to share experiences about how to access and analyse the spending data behind EU's budget. So join us <strong>Monday 18 February at 19:00 CET / 18:00 GMT</strong> for a Google Hangout. 

[Ronny Patz](http://twitter.com/ronpatz) from [Transparency International, Brussels](http://www.transparencyinternational.eu/) will join us to share his experiences on access to EU spending information. 

At the hangout we'll discuss how to get started if you want to report on the spending behind the EU budget, and try to answer: 
- Where to find EU spending data? 
If you have decided to investigate EU spending, one of the first steps will be to find where the spending data is published. We will talk about how to find spending data published both at [EU-level](http://ec.europa.eu/beneficiaries/fts/index_en.htm) and at [national level](http://eustructuralfunds.gov.ie/). Our [map of EU spending](http://openspending.org/resources/eu/index.html). 

- What's new to report on in the 2014-2020 EU budget?
What are the consequenses to individual prorgammes such as research or farm subsidies? 
How do I find out, if the distribution of structural funds between regions will change with the new budget? 

If the questions above have peeked your interest, come join us at the hangout. If you wish to get started now, have a look at some of the [EU spending data](http://openspending.org/eu-commission-fts] we're already featuring or our (notes on EU spending data)[http://openspending.org/resources/eu/notes.html).
