# Video Instruction Guide - Loading Data Into OpenSpending

Recently, the OpenSpending team have been working on a project to visualise financial data in Cameroon. One of the aims of the project is to create a platform which is sustainable for years to come and that means, that it needs to be easy to load and maintain datasets into OpenSpending.

So... we've created some screencasts about how to load data into OpenSpending. Please do take a look and try it out for yourself and let us know if anything needs to be clearer!

## Preparing your dataset information

First add information about your dataset to make it easily findable in OpenSpending

## Upload your data online

Next, you need to get your CSV file online

## Create a model to explain the structure of your data to OpenSpending

Next, tell OpenSpending how to understand your data by creating a model

If that's all gone well, you'll be able to move on to creating visualisations (video coming soon - watch this space!) and if not and you have some errors watch the video below to see what to do next.

## Not quite right? How to fix errors...

It doesn't always go right the first time you try and load your data - here's what to do if you have made a mistake either in your model or your data.
