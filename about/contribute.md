## Contribute to the platform

If you want to work with data already on OpenSpending you can dive right in and go to [the tutorials](http://openspending.org/help/index.html), or [register your details with us](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dENlX1RvOGFNeURBSDRkc2pVMjZvR0E6MA#gid=0) and we'll get back to you as soon as possible to help you get started. We also welcome help with translation of the platform into other langauges and suggestions for guest blog posts!

Analyse or wrangle one of the datasets already available on the OpenSpending [platform](http://openspending.org/datasets). 

Help us map cities already on OpenSpending by adding the information [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AqR8dXc6Ji4JdHZZNUpWQ2paY3FfYTdFNXkxZXZDTWc#gid=0).

### Help us uploading fresh data to OpenSpending
We are constantly taking on more data sets. Have a look to see if you help [clean and upload one of the datasets](https://docs.google.com/a/okfn.org/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AvdkMlz2NopEdElqWTBJS0Q1Q083VlI3YUFLTl9OY0E#gid=0) we're currently planning to add to OpenSpending. 

Get in touch about how you can help uploading fresh data via our [mailing list](http://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/openspending). 

### Are you a developer?
Of course, OpenSpending is an [open source](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl.html) 
project and we aim to include contributions into production as quickly 
as possible. 

We work as a distributed team and most discussions take place either on the
[openspending-dev](http://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/openspending-dev)
mailing list or on IRC (``#openspending`` on FreeNode).

If you feel like hacking core, check out the [GitHub organization](https://github.com/openspending) to see what is going on and where help is needed.
