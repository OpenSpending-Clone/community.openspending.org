## Contribute to the platform

Of course, OpenSpending is an [open source](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl.html) 
project and we aim to include contributions into production as quickly 
as possible. 

We work as a distributed team and most discussions take place either on the
[openspending-dev](http://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/openspending-dev)
mailing list or on IRC (``#openspending`` on FreeNode).

If you are interested in working with data from your country, you can either dive right in [follow the tutorials](http://openspending.org/help/index.html), or [register your details with us](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dENlX1RvOGFNeURBSDRkc2pVMjZvR0E6MA#gid=0) and we'll get back to you as soon as possible to help you get started. We also welcome help with translation of the platform into other langauges and suggestions for guest blog posts!

If you feel like hacking core, check out the [GitHub organization](https://github.com/openspending) to see what is going on and where help is needed.
