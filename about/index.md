# About OpenSpending

OpenSpending exists to **“map the money worldwide”** – that is, to track and analyse public financial information globally. Concretely, OpenSpending is:

* A central, high-quality, **open database** of public financial information, including budgets, spending, balance sheets, procurement etc
* A **community** of users and contributors to this database
* A set of open **resources** providing technical, fiscal, and political understanding necessary to work with financial information.

The OpenSpending database is a resource for the many individuals and groups who wish to discuss and investigate public financial information, including journalists, academics, campaigners, and more.
