###Le Monde (FR)
We experienced an extremely high traffic spike when a visualisation based on French data was featured in Le Monde in October 2012.
The article [PLF : des avions au bouclier fiscal, la java des amendements](http://www.lemonde.fr/politique/article/2012/10/16/plf-des-avions-au-bouclier-fiscal-la-java-des-amendements_1776093_823448.html?xtmc=depenses&xtcr=52), (PLF=Projet de loi de finances, the draft finance law) deals with suggested amendments to the draft finance law and which parties were demanding what amendments.
The OpenSpending visualisation used in the article is intended to give a high-level representation of some of the main areas of government expenditure in France.
