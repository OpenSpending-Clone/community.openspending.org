If you are a member of the OpenSpending community—whether you contribute datasets, work on building or testing code, or develop stories and visualizations using OpenSpending data—this site belongs to you.

The OpenSpending Community Site is a place to showcase the OpenSpending community's work and to share its resources. It includes:

* a [blog][1] to share new work by community members
* information about community [events][3b]
* a set of [help][4] documents on the OpenSpending system
* a collection of [research][2] using OpenSpending data and [resources][2] on spending data research
* guidance on [how to get involved][3] with the community

The Community Site is built using WordPress, which makes it easy for community members to contribute. Entries in the blog are simply [WordPress blog posts][5], and the other parts of the site are [WordPress Pages][6].

To get involved see the [Get Involved page][3].
