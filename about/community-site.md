If you are a member of the OpenSpending community—whether you
contribute datasets, work on building or testing code, or develop
stories and visualizations using OpenSpending data—this site belongs
to you.

The OpenSpending Community Site is a place to showcase the
OpenSpending community's work and to share its resources. It includes:

* a [blog][1] to share new work by community members
* information about community [events][3b]
* a set of [help][4] documents on the OpenSpending system
* a collection of [research][2] using OpenSpending data and [resources][2] on spending data research
* guidance on [how to get involved][3] with the community

The Community Site is built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and
hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), which makes it
easy for community members to contribute via pull requests on our
[GitHub repo](https://github.com/openspending/dotorg).  Our
[blog](http://blog.openspending.org) is powered by WordPress.

To get involved see the [Get Involved page][3].
