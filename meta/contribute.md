## Contribute to the platform

Of course, OpenSpending is an [open source](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl.html) 
project and we aim to include contributions into production as quickly 
as possible. 

We work as a distributed team and most discussions take place either on the
[openspending-dev](http://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/openspending-dev)
mailing list or on IRC (``#openspending`` on FreeNode).

If you feel like hacking core, check out the [GitHub organization](https://github.com/openspending) to see what is going on and where help is needed.
