Friedrich is the technical lead for OpenSpending and [Spending Stories](http://blog.okfn.org/2011/06/22/spending-stories-is-a-winner-of-the-knight-news-challenge/). He lives in Berlin and is a media scientist turned coder working on open government and transparency initiatives. After presenting the German state budget on [OffenerHaushalt.de](http://bund.offenerhaushalt.de/) in 2010, he is now working on technologies that allow the budgets and spending records of any state and region to explored. He also helped create data portals for a number of European administrations and is working on an effort to create a pan-European data catalogue at [publicdata.eu](http://publicdata.eu/). He is the author of [Adhocracy](https://adhocracy.de/), a collaborative drafting software used by the Internet commission of the German Bundestag and other organizations to enable citizens to contribute and vote on policy documents.
